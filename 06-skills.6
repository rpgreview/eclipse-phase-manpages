.SH Skills
.PP
In a setting where physical looks and capabilities are easily changed at
the push of a button, who you are and what you know is more important
than any inborn ability.
Skills represent the knowledge your character has, the accumulated set
of experience, education, and inherent know\-how possessed by each and
every sentient transhuman in Eclipse Phase.
They are what allow you to sneak into a hypercorp station, disable the
security systems, hack the mesh hub, and then impersonate security
personnel to make your escape.
Your skills represent the one thing you have no matter what you look
like or where you find yourself.
When your characters explore what they can do, their skills, or lack
thereof, often determine the margin between success and failure.
Having a well\-rounded set of skills is vital to survival and success in
Eclipse Phase.
The skills below encompass a wide selection of talents, enough so that
each character can be unique in their abilities and knowledge.
.SS Skill overview
.PP
Skills are divided into aptitudes and learned skills (see Character
Skills, p.
123).
Most (but not all) learned skills are built on and linked to an
aptitude.
If a character lacks the specific skill needed in a situation, they may
default to the linked aptitude.
You may also choose to specialize in certain skills (see
Specializations, p.
123), reflecting an enhanced knowledge of a particular aspect of a
certain skill.
.SS CORE SKILLS: APTITUDES
.PP
Aptitudes represent inherent skills and abilities acquired at birth or
during the course of growing up.
Aptitudes are sometimes used for tests, but their primary use is
determining the starting point at which learned skills are developed.
Aptitudes determine the starting value of their linked skills.
For example, a character with Somatics aptitude 10 who wishes to
purchase points in the Freerunning skill (which is linked to Somatics)
would start with a Freerunning rank of 10 and then buy additionally
points in that skill.
Aptitudes are also used when a character doesn't posses knowledge of a
needed skill (see Defaulting, p.
116).
Aptitudes represent the basic knowledge that a character has acquired
regarding rudimentary use of that skill.
They may not have ever received any formal training with the skill, but
they can still attempt to use it.
Aptitudes range in value from 1 to 30, with 10 being the unaugmented
human average and 15 representing the average of most genetically
modified transhumans.
Since aptitudes represent untrained ability, they are capped at a
maximum rating of 30.
There are seven different aptitudes that all players possess.
These aptitudes are purchased during character creation (p.
128), but depending on the morph the character is currently inhabiting,
they may find their aptitudes capped by the quality of the morph (see p.
124).
.SS LEARNED SKILLS
.PP
A player's learned skills are the most important part of their
character, representing the acquired knowledge they carry with them from
morph to morph, knowledge that plays a fundamental role in helping
define the person's ego.
Learned skills encompass nearly any skill that you might need to use in
Eclipse Phase, and they range in value from 0 to 99.
All learned skills have a linked aptitude that is used to calculate
their initial value, and which is also defaulted to if the player does
not have that particular skill.
.SS SKILL CATEGORIES
.PP
Each learned skill is classified as either an Active skill or a
Knowledge skill.
Active skills represent skills that typically require physical actions
and are used in action scenes within game play.
Knowledge skills are more knowledge\-based and intellectual,
representing ideas and facts.
Knowledge skills may play a less dramatic role in certain
action\-oriented game play moments, but they flesh out the character's
background and interests and are integral to roleplaying interactions.
Active and Knowledge skills are purchased separately during character
creation.
.PP
Active skills are further divided into Combat, Mental, Physical, Psi,
Social, Technical, and Vehicle skills.
Certain traits and abilities may apply to specific categories.
.SS FIELD SKILLS
.PP
Some learned skills are field skills, meaning that when this skill is
chosen a particular field of emphasis must also be selected.
For example, the skill of Academics requires the character to specify a
specific academic discipline in which they are knowledgeable, such as
Biology, Chemistry, or Xenosociology.
Field skills are written as \[lq][skill]: [field];\[rq] for example:
\[lq]Art: Painting.\[rq] Field skills can be taken multiple times,
choosing a different area of emphasis each time, reflecting skills in
different fields; that is to say, each field is a separate skill.
Several suggested fields are listed for each field skill, but
gamemasters and players may also cooperate to create others that fit
their games.
.PP
Field skills may also have specializations; for example, Professional:
Accounting (Money Laundering).
.SS PSI SKILLS
.PP
Psi refers to the ability to perceive and manipulate biological minds
via psi waves and/or other inexplicable phenomena.
Due to the uniqueness of this ability, characters that wish to wield psi
must acquire the Psi
.PP
trait (p.
147).
Psi use also requires a number of specialized skills (Control, Psi
Assault, and Sense) that reflect special training characters acquire to
tap into their psi powers.
Psi skills may not be defaulted on; the only way to use a psi skill is
to possess the trait along with training in that skill.
For more details, see Psi, p.
220.
.SS SPECIALIZATIONS
.PP
Any character may opt to specialize in a given skill (see
Specializations, p.
123).
This specialization reflects increased knowledge in one particular
aspect of the skill.
Many of the skills offered below include sample specializations.
Gamemasters and players are encouraged to develop other specialization
ideas together for their campaigns.
.PP
Specialization provides a +10 modifier when using that skill in a
situation appropriate to that specialization.
.SS USING SKILLS
.PP
Whenever a character wants to do something using a skill, they must
succeed at a skill test (see Making Tests, p.
115).
The difficulty of the action is applied as a modifier, as are any other
extenuating circumstances that may affect the test (see Difficulty and
Modifiers, p.
115).
As with other types of tests, all skill tests are successful when the
character rolls less than or equal to the test's target number after any
modifiers have been applied.
In the case of skill tests, the target number is the character's skill
rating with that particular skill.
Modifiers representing difficulty and other factors are applied directly
to the target number (see Difficulty and Modifiers, p.
115).
A roll of a 00 is always a success, regardless of modifiers, and a
result of 99 is always a failure, again despite any modifiers that may
increase a character's target number over 100.
Standard critical success and failure rules apply to skill tests (see
Criticals: Rolling Doubles, p.
116), so any time a character rolls a double (i.e.
00, 11, 22, 33, etc.) they score a critical success or failure.
.SS DEFAULTING
.PP
Sometimes you lack the skill needed in a certain situation.
In these instances, characters may default their skill test to the
linked aptitude.
This reflects the fact that most learned skills are developed from some
sort of baseline physical ability.
Even though you may not know how to do something, you've likely seen how
it's done at some point or have some idea of how to do it, or can at
least take a shot at it.
Naturally, you're not as good as someone who has training in that skill,
but it still allows you to make an attempt.
.PP
Not all skills can be defaulted.
Some skills are simply too complex or obscure, or demand special
knowledge or ability, for someone to attempt their use untrained.
For example, brain surgery or most psi skills are simply beyond anyone
who doesn't have that ability or the knowledge of what they're
attempting.
.SS DEFAULTING TO FIELD SKILLS
.PP
In some cases, a character may not possess the particular field skill
that a test calls for, but they may be skilled in another related field.
For example, a test to conduct an alien autopsy might call for an
Academics: Xenobiology roll, but a character who doesn't have that skill
may be allowed to default to Academics: Biology instead.
The gamemaster decides if and when to allow this, perhaps applying a
modifier to the test based on the difference between fields.
.SS DEFAULTING TO RELATED SKILLS
.PP
If the gamemaster allows it, characters may default to a related skill
that also has some relevance to the test at hand.
For example, a character skilled in Kinetic Weapons might not be trained
in the use of a laser, but they know enough to point at the target and
pull the trigger.
Likewise, a character might not be skilled in Investigation, but the
gamemaster could still allow them to use their Perception skill instead
in order to realize that a body had been moved from the place where it
had been shot.
In situations like this, when the gamemaster allows defaulting to a
related skill, a \[en]30 modifier should be applied to the test.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Example\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Srit is wandering through a black market souk on Mars, trying to find a
particular piece of sensory equipment.
The gamemaster calls for a Scrounging Test, but Srit does not have that
skill.
She could default her INT of 22, but instead she asks the gamemaster if
she can default to the related skill of Perception, which she has at 82.
The gamemaster agrees, and so Srit rolls against a target number of 52
(82 \[en] 30).
.RE
.SS COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS
.PP
Sometimes more than one skill may apply to a particular test, or
knowledge in one area can aid your skill in another.
In this case, the gamemaster may apply a modifier to the skill test
based on the strength of the complementing skill, as noted on the
Complementary Skill Bonus table.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Example\f[]
.PD 0

Dav is hoping to persuade a brinker pilot to take him to an isolated
habitat that doesn't welcome visitors.
To impress upon the pilot that he is a friend of these particular
isolates, he calls on his knowledge of their particular cultural
practices (Interests: Religious Cults skill at 45).
The gamemaster allows this and applies a +20 modifier to Dav's
Persuasion Test.

What is the difference between being a clumsy neophyte wobbling in zero
gravity and being a veteran gliding effortlessly through space as though
you were dancing?
The answer is training and skill.
The greater your skill, the more likely you are to not only succeed at
what you want to do, but succeed well.
.PP
Aptitudes in Eclipse Phase range from 1 to 30, while learned skills
range from 0 to 99.
These numbers are an abstraction of the range of transhuman abilities
and traits.
The Aptitude Range table provides a breakdown of different aptitude
levels and how they relate to each other.
Likewise, the Learned Skill Range table provides an interpretation for
the capabilities at different skill levels.

.SS APTITUDES
.PP
There are 7 aptitudes in Eclipse Phase, described on p.
123.
Each character has these aptitudes at a minimum rating of 1.
.SS APTITUDE\-ONLY TESTS
.PP
In rare cases, a test may call for using an aptitude only, rather than a
learned skill.
This should only occur when no learned skills are appropriate to the
test, and these circumstances are usually noted in the rules.
Aptitude\-only tests must be handled carefully, as the range of aptitude
ratings (1\[en]30) is typically much smaller than the rating of learned
skills (0\[en]99).
For this reason, most aptitude tests should use a target number equal to
the aptitude x 3.
In rare cases where the test is more difficult, the gamemaster may
simply use an aptitude x 2, or just the straight aptitude rating.
In some cases, more than one aptitude may be relevant to the test, and
so they may be added together to derive the target number.
What follows are a few examples where an aptitudeonly test might be
appropriate.
Gamemasters may call for similar tests in other situations, but learned
skills should be used whenever possible.

\f[B]APTITUDE COMPARISON: FLATS VS. SPLICERS AND EXALTS\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Compared to humans in the early 21st Century, the average transhuman in
the world of Eclipse Phase is faster, smarter, stronger, and healthier
than their unaugmented predecessors.
Normal unaugmented humans, called flats (p.
139), most closely approximate the type of person that was born in our
time.
The majority of people, however, inhabit bodies that are known as
splicers (p.
139) or exalts (p.
139) (well, those with biological bodies anyway).
Splicers are genefixed to avoid genetic defects and optimized for
certain characteristics, while exalts are tweaked to make them superior
across the board: they are more attractive, more athletic, have greater
cognitive capacity, and are more attuned to the world around them than
their unaugmented kin.

\f[B]NECESSARY SKILLS\f[]
.PP
While characters will need a mix of skills to succeed in the varied
tasks they encounter in Eclipse Phase, some skills are crucial for any
character.
If a character lacks these, they will have a difficult time getting by,
so it is important for players and gamemasters to know these particular
skills.
.PP
\f[B]Fray\f[]: Fray is the primary skill you use to avoid getting hit in
combat.
Even if you plan to avoid combat, being able to get out of the way when
necessary is a handy survival skill to have.
.PP
\f[B]Networking\f[]: Unless you live in total isolation, you need a
Networking skill\[em]preferably several.
Networking is how you interact with people in a particular social circle
to obtain information, spread rumors, call in favors, and so on.
.PP
\f[B]Perception\f[]: Perception Tests get called for quite often, so if
you want your character to know what's going on around them, make sure
to get this skill.
Investigation and Scrounging are also good, but Perception is king.

Exotic animals are considered a sign of prestige among the hypercorp
elites, and guard animals are occasionally used to protect
high\-security installations.

animal being trained, how domestic it is, and the complexity of the
task.
Once an animal has been trained, commanding it is treated as a Simple
Success Test (p.

trainer receives a +30 modifier on their Animal Handling Tests when
convincing the animal to complete the trained action.

With the Fall of Earth, the languages that remain most prominent in the
solar system are those that were extensively carried into space by
countries and hypercorps with aggressive space programs or by the large
populations of poor laborers and infomorph refugees that followed.
No single language dominated the realm of space expansion, and
multilingualism was common.
Many habitats and (sub) cultural groupings cling to specific languages
as a method of retaining cultural identity.
Despite the availability of instant translation via the mesh, many
people remain versed in two or more languages.
The ten most common languages in the solar system by speaking
populations are: Arabic, Cantonese, English, French, Hindi, Japanese,
Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.
Other languages that remain strong include Bengali, Dutch, Farsi,
German, Italian, Javanese, Korean, Polish, Punjabi, Swedish, Tamil,
Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Wu.
Some languages were effectively lost during the Fall, especially those
in some undeveloped regions, as their speaking populations did not
migrate into space pre\-Fall and were not privileged enough to survive
in large numbers as infomorph refugees.

\f[B]USING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
At first glance, it may seem that Knowledge skills have fewer in\-game
applications than Active skills.
To some degree this is the case.
The importance of Knowledge skills, however, should not be
underestimated.
While they play a role in analyzing clues and solving mysteries, the
real value of Knowledge skills is in helping the characters\[em]and the
players\[em]understand the world of Eclipse Phase.
In particular these skills can be used to make plans, assess a
situation, identify strengths and weaknesses, evaluate worth, make
comparisons, forecast probable outcomes, or understand the applicable
science, socio\-economic factors, or cultural or historical context.
For example, a group of characters looking to break into a facility
could use Profession: Security Procedures to evaluate the defenses,
Academic: Architecture to identify covert points of entry, Interests:
Sports to plan their infiltration at a time when the guards are likely
to be distracted, Interests: Triads to identify a local crime group that
can sell them breaking and entering gear, and Art: Sculpture when
picking a valuable art piece with which to bribe an insider.
When used appropriately, these skills can be just as beneficial as the
Active skills used to break inside, if not more so because the plan is
more likely to succeed as a result of this preparation.
It is largely up to the gamemaster to enforce how useful Knowledge
skills are in their game.
The easiest way to reinforce their relevance is to penalize characters
who don't take advantage of them.
For example, characters who didn't use their Profession: Security
Procedures in the example above might end up being surprised when they
run across a security system they are not prepared to deal with, forcing
them to improvise or even abandon their plans.
.RE
.SS SPECIAL SKILLS
.PP
While the preceding list represents the skills most commonly used in
Eclipse Phase, there may be certain skills called for in a campaign that
are not found in this book.
In this case, the gamemaster may work with the players to create a new
skill to fill this void.
This option should be used sparingly to prevent skill bloat, and all
skills are subject to approval by the gamemaster If you choose to create
a new skill, keep in mind that it needs to be linked to an existing
aptitude and should be a skill that is available to all characters, not
just specific to one character.
