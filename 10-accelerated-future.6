.SH Accelerated Future
.PP
The future setting of \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] introduces a number of
technological elements that have a strong impact on transhuman society.
These include backups and uploading, resleeving, egocasting, forking,
nano\-fabrication reputation systems, space habitats, and space travel,
among others.
.SS Backups And Uploading
.PP
The transhuman mind is no longer a prisoner of the biological hardware
on which it originates.
Through various mechanisms, biological brains may be digitally emulated,
allowing people to make a \f[I]backup\f[] of their minds, including
their entire personality, memories, and skills\[em]a process known as
\f[I]uploading.\f[]
.PP
The primary use of backups is to ensure the person's ego can be
retrieved in case of death, in which case they may be \f[I]resleeved\f[]
(p.
271).
For this reason, almost everyone in the solar system is equipped with a
cortical stack (p.
300).
Backups may also be safely archived in secure storage (p.
269) or used to create infomorphs (p.
264).
A person may also egocast themselves across the solar system as a form
of travel (p.
276).
.SS Cortical Stack Backups
.PP
Cortical stack implants deploy a network of nanobots throughout the
brain that take a snapshot of the mind's neural state, storing the data
as a backup within the cortical stack.
The average transhuman's cortical stack backs up their ego 86,400 times
per day.
Only the most recent backup is kept within the stack; older ones are
overwritten.
Pods and synthmorphs also can be equipped with cortical stacks (though
AI\-piloted bots often lack this feature), though these versions
maintain an updated copy of the ego running in the morph's cyberbrain.
.PP
In the case of death, accidental or otherwise, a cortical stack can be
retrieved from a corpse and used to recover the character, either as an
infomorph or by resleeving them in a new morph.
Cortical stacks are diamond\-hardened and protected, so they may often
be retrieved even if the corpse is badly mangled or damaged.
If the corpse cannot be recovered or the cortical stack is destroyed,
the backup is lost.
.PP
High rollers, well\-equipped brinkers, and others in dangerous
professions often opt for an emergency farcaster accessory (p.
306) that periodically (usually every 48 hours, but varying according to
contract) transmits a backup from the cortical stack to a remote storage
facility.
This option is quite expensive, however and so is generally only
afforded by the wealthy.
.SS Retrieving A Cortical Stack
.PP
Most cortical stacks are carefully excised from a corpse with surgery.
In certain circumstances, however, a character may need to extract a
cortical stack in the field, whether because transporting the corpse is
impractical or because the dead person is an enemy and they either don't
want them knowing who killed them or they want to interrogate them with
psychosurgery in a simulspace.
.PP
The process of cutting out a cortical stack is called \[lq]popping,\[rq]
as a skilled extractor can usually get the smooth\-shelled implant to
pop right out by making an incision in the correct place and applying
pressure.
One does need to be careful that the tiny, blood\-slick stack doesn't
slip away once popped.
.PP
Popping can be done with a sharp knife and elbow grease, though it is
grisly.
Popping a stack is a Task Action that requires a Medicine: [any
appropriate field] Test with a timeframe of 1 minute and a modifier of
+20.
Morphs with stacks in non\-standard locations or with anatomical
shielding (carapace plates, etc.) around the stack may incur penalties
to this test at the gamemaster's discretion.
Of course, if you don't have the time for a precise extraction, you can
always just cut the entire head off and take it with you.
.PP
Once a cortical stack is retrieved, it may be loaded into an ego bridge
(p.
328) and used to bring the ego back, either as an infomorph or by
resleeving.
.PP
\f[B]Living Subjects:\f[] Cortical stacks may be excised from living
people, but the process is usually fatal (or at least paralyzing) as it
involves cutting through the spinal column.
If the target is not unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, they must
first be immobilized in melee combat (see \f[I]Subdual,\f[] p.
204).
Cutting out the stack is handled like a Medicine Task Action as above,
but this process inflicts 3d10 + 10 damage on the target.
If the test fails, they still inflict 1d10 + 10 damage to the target.
If the person removing the stack wants to leave the target alive or harm
them as little as possible, they suffer a \[en]20 modifier on the test,
but may reduce the damage by 1d10 per 10 full points of MoS.
Living through the process of having your stack removed is traumatic;
anyone who does so suffers 1d10 mental stress.
.SS Destroying A Cortical Stack
.PP
Cortical stacks have an Armor of 20 and a Durability of 20 for anyone
attempting to destroy them.
.SS Uploading
.PP
Uploading a backup into secure storage is usually handled with a brain
scan at the storage facility's clinic using a bread box\-sized unit
called an \f[I]ego bridge\f[] (p.
328).
When activated, the ego bridge's sensor array twists open like a morning
glory blossom, revealing an enclosure with a neck rest that
automatically adjusts itself to morphs with oddly\-sized or \-shaped
heads.
The neck rest deploys millions of specialized nanobots into the brain
and central nervous system.
The petals are full of sensors that image the brain using a combination
of MRI, sonogram, and positional information broadcast by the nanobot
swarm in the morph's brain.
The ego bridge then builds a digital copy of the person's brain, which
is stored away in the service's highly secure, off\-the\-mesh, hardwired
data vaults.
.PP
In the case of pods, the ego bridge scans the biological brain bits and
also accesses the cyberbrain to copy the parts of the ego residing
there.
For synthmorphs, who have no biological brain, the process is much
simpler, as it simply requires accessing and making a copy of their
cyberbrain.
.PP
In a standard clinic with an undamaged morph, uploading takes only 10
minutes, 5 with a pod.
In other situations, however, the process may take longer if the
gamemaster so decides.
Uploading from a synthmorph or extracted cortical stack is
instantaneous.
The ego bridge largely operates itself.
While oversight by a medical specialist is a good idea, no test is
necessary.
.PP
If an uploading character does not plan to return to their morph, it is
usually put on ice until someone else resleeves into it.
If a new resleeve is not ready and the uploading character doesn't want
to leave a potential copy of themselves behind, they can have the
morph's mind wiped by the nanobots as part of the uploading process.
.SS Uploading\-Resleeving Continuity
.PP
In ideal circumstances, a person who is intentionally resleeving (p.
271) can arrange for the uploading and resleeving process to occur
without any noticeable loss of continuity.
Though the experience of switching from one morph to another is still a
bit jarring, the transition itself can be made into a seamless process,
with no gaps in awareness or memory, which helps reduce associated
mental stress.
.PP
In this case, during the process of uploading, the ego bridge is also
connected to another ego bridge and the new sleeve.
This connection can even be made wirelessly or by farcaster link (with a
maximum distance of 10,000 kilometers).
.PP
As the mind is uploaded, the ego bridge builds a virtual brain by
copying the morph's brain bit by bit, using the data gained from the
brain scan.
At the same time, this data is slowly copied to the new sleeve as
nanobots rewire the sleeve's brain structure (a much slower process).
As the transfer occurs, the nanobots in the brain sever individual
neural connections and re\-route them to their duplicates in the virtual
brain, and then eventually to the new brain.
Effectively, the character's ego is running partially on the meat brain
and partially on the virtual copy.
By the time the nanobots sever the last of the neural connections in the
old brain, the ego is running completely on the virtual brain and the
new sleeve's brain.
Once the resleeving is completed, the virtual brain is shut down.
.PP
In terms of perceptions, the character, who is awake during this
process, experiences a very gradual shift from one morph to the other.
As the process takes hours, however (or even longer if done via
farcaster), the subject usually entertains themselves with some AR
media, VR, or even XP to pass the time.
.SS Uploading After Death
.PP
It is possible to upload the mind of a person who has recently died as
long as the nanobots have time to scan the brain before cell
deterioration kicks in too heavily, which takes approximately 2 hours.
It is possible to sustain a corpse for longer by placing it in a healing
vat (p.
326) for nanostasis.
Post\-death uploads may suffer integrity damage; see \f[I]Backup\f[]
\f[I]Complications,\f[] p.
270.
Cyberbrains may also be retrieved from a destroyed synthmorph and
reactivated, assuming they are not damaged too heavily (gamemaster
discretion).
.SS Destructive Uploading
.PP
Though rare, some people engage in a process called destructive
uploading, where the biological brain is literally sliced apart and
scanned piece by piece.
Considered abhorrent and wasteful by most transhumans, brain\-peeling is
practiced by some bioconservative factions who view it as the only
\[lq]pure\[rq] method of uploading or the only real way to transfer the
\[lq]soul.\[rq] Such people typically refuse to resleeve, living out the
rest of their lives as infomorphs, quite often in dedicated simulspaces
that are treated as a sort of virtual afterlife.
.SS Backup Insurance
.PP
Almost everyone, with the exception of neo\-primitivists and very young
children, has a cortical stack.
In the event of death, however, a cortical stack alone will not ensure
resurrection unless you have acquired backup insurance (p.
330) to cover the costs of your resleeving Going without backup
insurance for any length of time is taking a severe risk.
Some jurisdictions (such as the Titanian Commonwealth) have a practice
of bringing everyone back, even if only to an infomorph state, or at
least filing the most recent backup away in dead storage just in case
someone decides to pay to resurrect them later.
Other authorities will simply destroy the stack or, worse, sell it on
the black market to a soul\-trading syndicate such as Nine Lives.
Backup insurance typically includes a subscription to an uploading
facility, usually requiring a visit every 6 months, to ensure that
backup is held in safe storage in case of cortical stack loss.
People with risky jobs (construction bot supervisor, hypercorp exoplanet
staff, girl who fights vicious giant eels for rich jaded audiences,
etc.) may back up once a week, or even daily.
In the event of a verified death where the cortical stack could not be
retrieved, the most recent backup is used to resleeve the person.
At the basic level, backup insurance will bring the character back as an
infomorph, at which point they can access their credit and purchase a
new morph.
More expensive versions will automatically resleeve you in the
pre\-purchased morph of your choice.
The exceedingly rich will often have customized clones (often of their
original body) waiting on ice for them.
.PP
Backup insurance often involves a missing person clause, which states
that a person will be brought back if they have not checked in for X
amount of time (a calendar function automatically handled by your muse)
and cannot be located.
.PP
It is worth noting that some criminal syndicates also offer backup
insurance at a much reduced rate.
The likelihood that copies of your backup are being used for illicit
purposes, however, is quite high.
For some people, however, what happens to a copy of themselves is of no
concern.
.SS Backup Insurance Limitations
.PP
Backup insurance is not always perfect.
Though insurance providers are required to make a reasonable effort to
retrieve your cortical stack, for many hypercorps this is a simple
cost\-benefit analysis that often will not work in the character's
favor.
If you died in a dangerous area such as the Zone on Mars, in a remote
area such as the Kuiper Belt, or are simply difficult to track down
(pushed out an airlock somewhere), odds are against your cortical stack
being retrieved\[em] instead you will be re\-instanced from a backup.
.PP
Jurisdiction can also play an important role.
The insurance offered by many inner system providers is automatically
nullified if you travel to an anarchist habitat, gatecrash, break the
law, or engage in certain life\-threatening activities like suicide
sports or scavenging in TITAN\-infected ruins.
At the least, they will refuse to retrieve your stack in these
circumstances.
Likewise, if you struck a backup insurance deal with a medical
collective from an autonomist habitat and then go and die on a hypercorp
station, the hypercorp is very likely to refuse to recognize the
authority of a bunch of anarchists and won't hand your stack over.
.PP
Even an archived backup and a missing person clause is no guarantee.
A determined enemy could capture you, pry the backup insurance access
codes from your muse, keep you on ice or quietly kill you, and then
regularly \[lq]check in\[rq] on your behalf using the access codes so
that the insurance provider never realizes you are dead or missing.
Though this requires quite a bit of effort, it is often less difficult
than dealing with an immortal opponent who keeps coming back no matter
how often you kill them.
.PP
Other dangers also exist.
An entire habitat may be destroyed, taking you, your backups, and your
insurance provider's records with it.
A resourceful enemy might penetrate a provider's security and delete
your backups, or simply bribe the right people to make sure they get
\[lq]accidentally\[rq] corrupted.
Given these possibilities, the paranoid often make sure to get multiple
redundant backup policies, assuming they can afford it.
.SS Backup Complications
.PP
In most cases, backing up/uploading is risk free unless someone tampers
with the equipment.
If the character suffered brain or neurological damage, the backup is
transferred via farcasting, or the upload is made from a dead character,
then the backup may be damaged due to missing neural information.
In any of these instances, make a LUC Test for the character.
If the test fails, they suffer 1 point of mental stress per 10 full
points of MoF.
Note that this stress (and possible trauma applies to the backup, not
the original character.
If the backup is used to re\-instantiate the character, however, then
the stress is applied.
.SS Resleeving
.PP
\f[I]Resleeving\f[] (also called remorphing) is the process of giving a
new body to an ego.
Changing bodies is a normal part of life for hundreds of millions of
transhumans, and it is an even more frequent occurrence for people in
certain professions.
Characters involved in specialized work may resleeve as often as once a
month.
Those who travel frequently may do so even more often.
Also, given the number of infugees who died during the Fall but have now
acquired a new morph, the vast majority of transhumanity has resleeved
at least once.
As such, most transhumans are accustomed to resleeving.
.PP
Adjusting to a new body takes time and a bit of effort (see
\f[I]Integration,\f[] p.
272).
Resleeving is also difficult psychologically, as reflected by continuity
(p.
272) and alienation (p.
272).
.PP
Once an ego fully inhabits a new morph, the new morph's cortical stack
needs ten minutes to amass a complete backup of the ego.
.SS Resleeving Biomorphs And Pods
.PP
Resleeving takes about an hour in a properly equipped clinic.
In essence, the process works like uploading in reverse.
The new sleeve is hooked up to an ego bridge which infiltrates the brain
with nanobots that physically restructure the brain's neural structure
and connections according to the map provided by the backup.
Sleeving takes six times as long as uploading because the nanobot swarm
working as a wet printer in the template brain needs to duplicate the
entire physical structure of the ego's neural network.
For resleeving, a \[lq]wet\[rq] ego bridge is used, meaning that the
sleeve and ego bridge are submerged in a vat filled with nanogel.
.PP
The resleeving process for pods takes only half an hour, as pods brains
are half biological and half cyberbrain.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Resleeving And The Gamesmaster\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The gamemaster has a fine amount of control over what a character can
obtain when resleeving.
The characters may be supplied with new morphs by Firewall or whatever
employer/patron for whom they are currently working.
In this case, the gamemaster can simply assign whatever morphs they see
fit \[em] with complete control over enhancements, traits, etc.
While morphs should be tailored for the mission at hand, this presents
an opportunity for the gamemaster to throw the characters some new toys
to play with and also some new challenges to overcome.
Gamemasters are encouraged to mix it up, have fun, and give players
something they can work with without necessarily giving them everything
they want.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
In other cases, the availability of desired morphs may be limited by the
resleeving location.
A small outpost in the wilds of Mars is unlikely to have a wide
selection of morphs \[em] in fact, a few rusters and synthmorphs may be
all they have.
Similarly, large habitats have a high demand for good morphs, so there
may be a waiting list for top\-of\-the\-line sylphs or remade morphs,
for example.
In the same vein, available morphs are going to be subject to local
legalities, so getting that reaper morph may be out of the question.
Characters could always turn to black market morph providers, but these
come with their own risks.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
What this means is that gamemasters should never be afraid to say no if
a character is pursuing a morph that is unreasonable or potentially
disruptive to the game.
While it's good form to give the players what they want once in a while,
it also makes for more interesting roleplaying to saddle them with
morphs that are a little different than what they were hoping for or
that come with some interesting challenges, such as a physical
addiction.
For extra fun, leave the character unaware of a morph's negative traits
or secret implants until they reveal themselves.
As always, the goal is to have fun, but variety often helps with that.
.RE
.SS Resleeving Synthmorphs
.PP
Resleeving into the cyberbrain of a synthmorph is much easier and
quicker, being a matter of copying the backup into the cyberbrain (an
instantaneous affair) and then running the backup in its virtual brain
state (1 Action Turn).
The drawback to synthmorphs is that they are more difficult to acclimate
to (see \f[I]Integration,\f[] p.
272), they are vulnerable to cyberbrain hacking (p.
261), and synthmorphs are viewed as low class in some cultures.
.SS Evacuating A Cyberbrain
.PP
Characters inhabiting a synthmorph cyberbrain may voluntarily choose to
evacuate by copying themselves as an infomorph onto another device.
This takes 1 full Action Turn.
See \f[I]Infomorph Resleeving,\f[] p.
273.
.SS Resleeving Costs
.PP
The costs involved for the resleeving process itself are generally
subsumed in the costs of the backup insurance and/or the new sleeve
itself.
Costs for individual morphs are noted in the descriptions starting on p.
139.
See \f[I]Morph Brokerage\f[] (p.
276) for rules on finding and acquiring morphs.
.SS Integration
.PP
Getting used to a new body typically takes some time.
The character must become acclimated to the changes in height, weight,
sex, and capabilities, which often requires unlearning ways of doing
things that worked fine for their previous form.
Resleeving in a synthetic morph or an uplift is also quite confusing at
first, given the drastically different morphologies, change in limb
structure (and sometimes amount of limbs), and so on.
Luckily, transhuman minds are adaptive things, and this process is aided
by the application of mental \[lq]patches\[rq] during the resleeving
process that give the character a bit of a boost for using their new
body.
.PP
An ego in a new morph makes an Integration Test upon taking control of
the body, rolling SOM x 3 (morph bonuses do not apply) and applying
modifiers from the Integration and Alienation Modifiers table.
The result of the test is explained on the Integration Test table, p.

.SS Alienation
.PP
After loss of continuity, the other major factor impacting resleeving
characters is alienation.
Once the ego has its new sleeve under control, it's time to look in the
mirror.
The alienation test reflects the experience of coming to terms with a
new face, skin, and brain.
For example, transferring to a radically different morph (such as a
swarmanoid) can be difficult to grasp.
Uplifts often have difficulty getting acquainted with the differing
hormonal urges of a human biomorph and vice versa.
While the character's ego is as it was in their last sleeve, the brains
and neurochemistry of many morphs may alter aptitudes like WIL or COG.
The effects of this can be frustrating or disorienting.
Every character makes an Alienation Test to reflect how mentally
stressful it is to get a grip on their new body, rolling INT x 3 and
apply modifiers from the Integration and Alienation Modifiers table.
Consult the Alienation Test table to determine the effects.

.SS Continuity Test
.PP
Perhaps the biggest shock that strikes most resleeving characters is the
loss of continuity of self.
This is particularly true for characters who died.
If their cortical stack was retrieved, they will remember their own
death.
If they were restored from an archived backup, they will not remember
their death, but they will have lost an entire period of their
life\[em]all the way back to their last backup.
In fact, if their body was not recovered, they may not even know that
they are dead for certain\[em]there may be a surviving copy of
themselves out there.
The driving point in this loss of continuity is a sort of existential
crisis\[em]they are no longer the original person they once were.
This leads some to question whether they are who they think they are, or
are they some poor imitation and not a real person at all?
To determine how this loss of continuity affects a character, make a
Continuity Test by rolling WIL x 3.
Every character suffers stress from loss of continuity, as noted on the
Continuity Stress table.
Reduce this stress damage by 1 point per 10 full points of MoS on the
Continuity Test, or increase it by 1 point for every 10 full points of
MoF.
.SS Infomorph Resleeving
.PP
Rather than resleeving into a physical body, a backup may instead by
instantiated as an infomorph, a purely digital form.
Infomorphs are distinct from backups in that backups are inert files.
Infomorphs are backups imprinted onto a virtual brain template and run
as a program.
This virtual brain state must be run on a specific device and follows
all of the rules noted for infomorphs on p.
264.
Infomorphs may copy themselves to other devices, typically erasing
themselves from the previous device as they go.
Infomorphs that copy without erasing are treated as forks.
Characters instantiating as infomorphs must make Continuity and
Alienation Tests, just like resleeving.
Infomorphs may be resleeved into physical morphs, following normal
resleeving rules.

.SS Forking And Merging
.PP
With all of these backups of transhuman minds on file and an abundance
of mesh space on which to run them as virtual brains, one might wonder
what's to stop post\-Fall transhumanity from multiplying its numbers by
running additional copies of them.
The short answer is: nothing, aside from massive social stigma and
thorny psychological issues.
Taking a backup of a transhuman mind, copying it, and re\-instancing it
as an infomorph is called \f[I]forking.\f[] It's one of the most useful
and still\-controversial applications of transhumanity's brain science.
.PP
There are four classifications of forks: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma.
Though typically copied as infomorphs there is nothing preventing a fork
from being sleeved in a physical morph as well, other than legalities
and custom.

.SS Alpha Forks
.PP
An \f[I]alpha fork\f[] is an exact copy of the original ego,
re\-instanced as a separate infomorph.
An alpha fork may be created by copying and running an infomorph (from a
backup, infomorph, synthmorph cyberbrain, or a removed cortical stack in
an ego bridge).
Alpha forks mat be generated from biomorph brains using an ego bridge
and the same process as uploading (p.
268).
Alpha forks are an exact copy of the character's ego, with all of the
same skills, memories, stats, traits, personality, etc.
New alpha forks must make an Alienation Test (p.
272), and possibly a Continuity Test (p.
272) if copied from a backup.
.PP
Creating alpha forks is illegal in many jurisdictions including most of
the inner system and the Jovian Republic.
In others it tends to be viewed with distaste, though there are some
habitats/cultures in which it is encouraged.
.SS Beta Forks
.PP
Beta forks are partial copies of the ego.
They are intentionally hobbled so as to not to be considered an equal to
the character, for legal and other reasons.
Beta forks have most of the same skills as the original ego, though
sometimes reduced.
Their memories are also drastically curtailed, usually tailored to
whatever task they are intended to perform.
Beta forks are created by taking an alpha fork and running it through a
process known as \f[I]neural pruning\f[] (p.
274).
They are legal and even common in many places, except for
bioconservative holdouts like the Jovian Republic, though delta forks
are more favored.
Beta forks rarely have anything resembling civil rights or citizenship
and are usually treated as the property of the originating ego.
They are commonly used as digital aids or to represent the original ego
when communicating with others over great distances.

Beta forks take 1 minute to generate.
.SS Delta Forks
.PP
Delta forks are extremely limited copies of an ego.
They are more akin to AI templates upon which the ego's surface
personality traits are imprinted.
Also created via neural pruning, delta forks are highly functional (as
competent as a beta fork or AI) but have extremely limited skills and
heavily edited memories, usually to the point of being functional
amnesiacs.

.PP
Additional changes may apply as determined by the neural pruning test.
Delta forks take 1 Action Turn to generate.
.SS Gamma Forks
.PP
More commonly known as \f[I]vapors,\f[] gamma forks are massively
incomplete, corrupted, or heavily damaged copies of an ego.
Vapors are not intentionally created and are instead the results of
botched uploads, scrambled backups, incomplete or jammed farcasts, or
infomorphs/forks that were somehow damaged or went insane.
It is extremely rare for anyone to purposely create a vapor for anything
other than research use, although they can crop up in some interesting
places.
For example, poorly made skill software occasionally includes enough of
the personality traits and memories of the person the skill was taken
from that it can behave in a vapor\-like fashion when used.
.PP
Because vapors are anomalies rather than purposeful creations, the
characteristics of individual gamma forks are left to the gamemaster.
They should have some or all of the following: reduced skills, reduced
aptitudes, incomplete or incoherent memories, negative mental traits,
and persistent mental stress or traumas including derangements and/or
disorders.
.SS Neural Pruning
.PP
Neural pruning is the art of taking a backup/infomorph and trimming it
down to size so that it functions as either a beta or delta fork.
.PP
Beta forks are created by taking a virtual mind state that is
intentionally inhibited and filtering a copy of the ego through it.
Like a topiary shrub, the portions of the character's neural network
that exceed the capacities of the intended fork are trimmed away.
In addition to the changes noted under \f[I]Beta Forks\f[] (p.
273), characters may voluntarily choose to delete/decrease skills and
remove memories.
.PP
Delta forks are created by excising the ego's surface personality traits
and applying them to an AI template.
In this case the ego's memories are usually excluded entirely\[em]it is
easier to start with a blank delta fork and feed them the specific
memories/knowledge they need.
As with beta forks, characters making delta forks may voluntarily choose
to delete/decrease skills and keep specific memories.
If an alpha fork is not available to prune, a delta fork can be whipped
up from a biomorph brain with an ego bridge and 1 minute.
Many people sleeved in biomorphs keep delta forks on hand in storage, to
whip up on the fly as needed.
.PP
Transhumanity's grasp of neuroscience extends to scanning and copying a
mind, but the most intricate workings of memory are still imperfectly
understood.
Making precise edits to individual portions of a neural network (to
alter recollections, skills, and the like) is still a black art.
The difficulty with neural pruning is that taking a weed whacker to the
tree of memory isn't an exact science.
Specific memories may not be excised or chosen\[em]at best, memories may
be handled in broad clumps, typically grouped by time periods no finer
than 6 months.
For simplicity, most beta forks are created by removing all memories
older than 1 year.
.PP
When creating a beta or delta fork, the character must make a
Psychosurgery Test (other parties may make this test on the character's
behalf, representing that the character is giving them access to prune
the fork appropriately).
If the character succeeds, the fork is created as desired.
If the test fails, the gamemaster chooses one of the following penalties
for every 10 full points of MoF.
Some of these penalties may be combined for a cumulative effect:
.IP \[bu] 2
1 additional skill decreased by \[en]20
.IP \[bu] 2
Fork acquires a Negative mental trait worth 10 CP
.IP \[bu] 2
Fork suffers 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) mental stress
.IP \[bu] 2
Extra memory loss (gamemaster discretion; beta forks only)
.IP \[bu] 2
1 Positive trait lost
.SS Neural Pruning With Long\-Term Psychosurgery
.PP
Rather than generating forks on the fly, some characters prefer to have
carefully\-pruned forks on hand, stored as inert files that can be
called up, copied, and run as needed.
These forks are crafted with long\-term psychosurgery, meaning that they
suffer fewer drawbacks and the memories may be more finely tuned.
.PP
Long\-term neural pruning requires a Psychosurgery Test as above, but
with a +30 modifier.
Delta forks take 1 week to prune this way, beta forks take 1 month.
Additional modifications may be made to the fork using any of the normal
rules for psychosurgery (p.
229).
.PP
It is worth noting that some people prefer to use forks of themselves or
loved ones rather than a muse.
Likewise, some wealthy hyperelites are known to keep copies of their
younger backups on hand, sometimes for decades, and re\-instance these
when their prime ego has enough skill and experience to completely
outclass its younger selves.
Though technically these are alpha forks, their lag behind the original
ego is comparable in degree to that of a beta fork.
This is rumored to be the method used by the Pax Familiae in instancing
her army of cloned selves.
.SS Handling Forks
.PP
Gamemasters are encouraged to allow players to roleplay their
character's own forks.
It is important to note, however, that even with alpha forks, once the
fork and originating ego diverge, they develop onward as separate
people.
The events that shape the primary ego's personality, character, and
knowledge will not happen\[em]or even if they do, probably not in the
same way\[em]to the fork, and vice versa.
The exact dividing line between an ego and a fork is a central
philosophical and legal debate among many transhumans.
This means that gamemaster should not be afraid to pull a fork out of a
player character's hands and make them into an NPC if they start too
diverge too greatly.
Similarly, if a fork begins to learn information that the main character
does not (yet) have access to, it is probably also better to run the
fork as an NPC in order to avoid metagaming.
It is entirely possible that a fork might decide that it will no longer
obey the originating ego and carry about doing its own thing.
This usually only occurs with alpha forks, who are essentially a full
copy anyway, and as time passes the idea of merging back with the
original ego becomes unappealing.
Beta and delta forks are quite aware of their nature as incomplete
copies, and so usually return back home to the ego for reintegration.
In rare cases, however, even these might make a break for life on their
own.
.SS Merging
.PP
Merging is the process of re\-integrating a previously\-spawned fork
with the originating ego.
Merging is performed on conscious egos/forks, transferring both to a
single, merged ego.
The process is not difficult to undergo when two forks have only been
apart a short time.
As forks spend more time apart, though, merging bll, a Psychosurgery
Test is called for (made either by the ego or another character
overseeing the process).
The Merging table lists modifiers for this test as well as the result of
success or failure.
For synthmorphs, merging takes one full Action Turn.
For biomorphs, an ego bridge (p.
328) or mnemonic augmentation (p.
307) is required to merge, and the process takes 10 minutes.
The result of the process is a unified ego, whether or not the Merging
Test succeeds.
Psychotherapy (p.
209) and psychosurgery (p.
229) can troubleshoot bad merges over time.

Forking and merging have changed the way transhumanity thinks about the
self and what it means to have a well\-integrated personality.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
While forking is child's play from a technological standpoint, the
psychological and social effects of cloning a mind mean that most people
are cautious about employing forks.
Some jurisdictions ban forking outright for all but medical uses, while
others have severe restrictions.
In many hypercorp jurisdictions, for instance, alpha forks are illegal
and letting a beta fork run for more than 4 hours without merging
violates the modern descendants of 20th\-century anti\-trust laws.
Similarly, the Jovian Junta and other bioconservatives ban forking
entirely.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Disposing of unwanted forks is another thorny issue.
In some places, it's as simple as deleting them, because a stored mind
has no legal status.
In others, a fork that doesn't wish to merge back with its originating
ego might be accorded some rights, though these are generally only
granted to alpha forks.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Most significantly, though, running a shortterm fork of oneself for
periods of an hour or less is an easy task for many transhumans.
Many people use forks of themselves to get work done in everyday life,
and almost everyone has at least experimented with forking at some
point.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Transhumans view forking a bit like early 21st\-century humans viewed
drinking and drug use.
A bit might be okay, but someone overdoing it will be stigmatized.
This is because most transhumans understand the psychological
consequences of overusing forks.
.RE
.SS Egocasting
.PP
In spite of being a spacefaring civilization with outposts throughout
the solar system and beyond, transhumanity makes scant use of spacecraft
for interplanetary travel.
Shuttlecraft using a variety of propulsion systems make regular trips
between habitats, planetary surfaces, and moons.
But for any trip longer than 1.5 million kilometers\[em]the distance a
fusion drive craft can cover in a day\[em]people egocast.
Egocasting is transhumanity's most advanced personal transportation
technology, though only the character's ego actually travels.
Egocasting combines the technologies of uploading and quantum farcasting
to transfer a backup (or sometimes even a conscious ego, see p.
269) over interplanetary distances.
.PP
Though egocasting occurs at the speed of light, egocasting times vary
drastically with distance.
Egocasting within a cluster or planetary system is usually just a matter
of minutes.
Egocasting from the sun to the Kuiper Belt, however, takes between 40
and 70 hours, and so egocasting all of the way across the solar system
can take even longer.
.PP
Once an ego arrives at the destination receiver, it can be archived, run
as an infomorph, or resleeved as normal.
.SS Egocaster Security
.PP
Beaming yourself across interplanetary space is a mature technology and
usually works seamlessly.
Because egocasting uses quantum farcasters, there is no danger of radio
interference cooking the signal and causing data loss.
Normally the entire process is mediated by the character's backup
service, and security breaches are uncommon.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
However, there are several risks involved in egocasting The most obvious
is that the character's consciousness is transferred as a digital backup
file at the destination.
If the egocaster on the other end is not trusted or the networks at the
destination are privately controlled by the receiver, the character is
potentially putting themself at the mercy of their host.
Most hypercorps consider meddling with a transmitted ego to be a serious
breach of etiquette, whereas autonomist types would find it unthinkably
repressive.
However, political extremist groups and criminal organizations in
control of egocasters suffer from fewer restraints.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
A more subtle risk is the possibility for hackers to exploit security
holes in the egocaster and its attached virtual space to steal a fork of
the character.
This is extremely difficult to do.
It almost never happens during a normal upload, because the uploading
services are security conscious to the point of paranoia.
Even so, the forks stolen by such attempts more often than not end up
being vapors, because the intruder is usually stopped before a full copy
can be obtained.
.SS Darkcasting
.PP
Characters who want to egocast without the attention of public officials
like Immigration and Customs must seek out so\-called darkcasting
services\[em]illegal farcaster transceivers typically operated by
criminal syndicates and other clandestine groups.
To locate such a service, a character must use their Networking skill
and possibly their reputation (p.
285).
.SS Morph Brokerage
.PP
Morphs are a major commodity in transhuman society.
The technology and materials needed to grow new morphs are cheap and
abundant, though they take time.
Cloned biomorphs take at least a year and a half, even with accelerated
growth.
Pods, which are typically pieced together from vat\-grown parts, take
about 6 months.
Synthmorphs like cases and synths can be produced in a day, whereas more
complicated models can take a week or more.
Theoretically, supply will one day outstrip demand to the point where
flesh is free.
.PP
Characters have several options for acquiring morphs when they travel by
egocast, suffer heavy damage, or just feel like a new body.
When egocasting, the most common method for travelers of middling means
is to store their current morph in a body bank's secure facility and
lease a morph at their destination Less commonly, characters may rely on
public resleeving facilities, or, if they have the means, they may
purchase a new morph outright.
Characters who expect to stay at their destination indefinitely or who
decide to resleeve but aren't traveling might instead opt for a
trade\-in on their old body, leaving it behind permanently in most
cases.
.SS Morph Availability
.PP
As noted under \f[I]Resleeving and the Gamemaster\f[] (p.
271), finding the model of morph you want is not always easy.
While many basic morph types (cases, synths, splicers) are generally
available, characters can also locate new While many basic morph types
(cases, synths, splicers) are generally available, characters can also
locate new morphs using their Networking skills (see \f[I]Reputation\f[]
\f[I]and Social Networks,\f[] p.
285).
Certain morph types are harder to find then others; the gamemaster
should apply an appropriate modifier for any morphs that seem rare or
unusual (for example, swarmanoids or reapers).
Likewise, some morphs may simply be unavailable in a given locale.
Rusters are rarely available off of Mars, for example, while on Europa,
most morphs are exotic local aquatic varieties.
.PP
The gamemaster determines which factions are able to provide new morphs
in a given locale.
Factions will not provide morphs that are unavailable to that faction as
starting characters.
If the faction is not the dominant one in that locale, a penalty should
be applied ranging from \[en]10 to \[en]30.
Despite having a presence in a given locale, some factions may be unable
to provide morphs at all.
.PP
If the character is seeking a customized morph with specific implants or
enhancements, the search will be more challenging.
The gamemaster should apply a \[en]10 to \[en]30 modifier here as well,
depending on the extent and legality of the modifications sought.
.SS Morph Acquisition
.PP
Once a morph is located, the character may call in favors (p.
285) or pay credits for it.
Morph costs are noted on the Morph Costs table.
In the inner system, morph prices are often inflated by demand in the
market such that the most desirable morph types can cost a small
fortune.
Outsystem, prices in rep are more reasonable but still steep due to
population pressures on life support\-dependent outer system
settlements.
For travelers and frequent body hoppers, there are a number of ways to
defray these costs.
.SS Brokerage And Matchmaking
.PP
Finding morphs for travelers and the bodiless is a specialized skill
demanding deep social networks and a flair for negotiation.
In general, it's a seller's market, so brokers (or
\[lq]matchmakers,\[rq] as they're called in the open economy) act as
agents for the person seeking a body.
The Morph Costs table assumes a 10% fee paid to the broker.
Characters wishing to cut out the middleman may reduce cost by 10% but
take a \[en]30 penalty on their Networking Test to locate an available
morph.
.SS Customized Morphs
.PP
If a character seeks to have a customized morph (with extra bioware,
cyberware, or nanoware implants or robotic enhancements), the costs for
these enhancements are added to the morph's cost (if the gamemaster
chooses, discount package deals may apply).
Likewise, morphs may come saddled with positive or negative morph traits
(p.
145).
These traits raise or lower the morph's cost at a rate of +500 credits
per CP for positive traits, or \[en]200 credits per CP of negative
traits.
Negative traits typically reflect abuses the morph has suffered at the
hands of previous occupants.
.SS Trade\-In
.PP
For those who wish to leave their old morph behind permanently,
trade\-ins on current morphs are an option.
The high demand for bodies means that a buyer is almost always available
unless the gamemaster finds extenuating circumstances.
Morphs may be traded in for the value shown on the Morph Costs table
adjusted for any positive or negative traits), less a 10% physical exam
and finder's fee.
This is either paid to the morph broker in cred or rendered as a favor
using rep.
.SS Patron Provisioning
.PP
Characters on missions for rich or influential patrons may have morphs
provided for them.
Normally such provisions are made for the duration of a job, although
less commonly the morph itself might be payment for services rendered.
Gamemasters are encouraged to be creative with such arrangements, though
players should be advised that such bargains can quickly turn Faustian.
.SS Black Market Morphs
.PP
Black market body traders promise to provide the buyer with morphs and
upgrades of choice regardless of a habitat's laws against weapons or
implants, in addition to bypassing standard arrival registration via
darkcasting.
Illegal morphs usually come with a price markup (+25% at least), whereas
used morphs with unsavory backgrounds (and traits) can usually be
acquired on the cheap (\[en]25%).

.SS Indenture
.PP
Characters who find themselves too destitute to afford a new morph can
strike a deal for indentured service\[em]a \[lq]deal\[rq] that is rarely
advantageous to the new indenture.
Typical contracts require years of indentured labor\[em]terraforming
Mars, herding comets, asteroid mining, constructing habitats, colonizing
exoplanets, etc.\[em]in exchange for a cheap synthetic morph or splicer
at the end of the term.
Gamemasters may use their discretion in offering such terms, though in
many cases the terms offered will temporarily or permanently end the
character's career as a free agent.
Hypercorps using indentured labor are notorious for changing the terms
at a whim, extending the service period, or slamming the indenture with
a slew of hidden and outrageous charges that were not made clear up
front.
Characters may, of course, enter into such service fully intending to
grab their morph and run at the first opportunity, but the hypercorps
are very protective of their investments.
Indentures are closely monitored and tracked, and the hypercorps are not
above sending ego hunters to retrieve a runaway.
.SS Public Resleeving
.PP
Some locales, notably Titan, have a well\-developed public resleeving
infrastructure intended to provide a body to anyone who needs one.
Morphs provided are usually unremarkable cases, synths, or splicers with
no Positive traits or optional implants.
Anyone holding citizenship in a locale with public resleeving may apply
for a body.
Wait times are between a month and two years, with Reputation
influencing wait times at the gamemaster's discretion.
.SS Renting Morphs
.PP
For temporary visits where an infomorph won't do, morphs may be leased
rather than bought.
The cost to rent a morph is 1% of its cost per day, plus a Low charge
for resleeving.
This cost includes rental insurance (see below).
If the rental insurance is waived (not always possible unless you have a
good Rep), the rental cost may be reduced by half.
.PP
Characters who are leasing a morph may also use their previous morph as
collateral.
In this case, deduct the cost of the character's current morph from the
rental morph before calculating the 1% cost per day, with a minimal
rental cost of 10 credits per day.
.SS Penal Lease
.PP
Characters visiting the inner system or Jovian Republic may be able to
lease morphs belonging to prisoners.
In most jurisdictions, criminals are sentenced to terms in
rehabilitative simulspace with a stipulation that the prisoner's morph
becomes state property during their term of incarceration.
Morphs acquired this way often have complicated histories but also tend
to have modifications useful to Firewall agents.
Conversely, characters who find themselves imprisoned may be subject to
having their body leased out during incarceration.
.PP
The effects of taking a penal lease are at the discretion of the
gamemaster.
A character may have to pull some strings with their Reputation in order
to lease such a morph, especially if it has restricted or illegal
modifications.
Negative traits, cases of mistaken identity, and unfortunate encounters
with friends and associates of the morph's former occupant are among the
possible drawbacks to this type of arrangement.
On the up side, penal leases may reduce costs for both leasing and
insuring the morph, again subject to the gamemaster's discretion.
.SS Rental Insurance
.PP
Leased morphs must be covered by an insurance policy, which often
restricts the character from breaking the law or taking the morph
anywhere too dangerous or lawless.
Characters may purchase hazard insurance that will cover taking the
morph into certain dangerous situations, but this will double the rental
price at minimum.
.PP
If a character suffers extensive organic damage or death while insured,
the insurance will cover 80% of the morph's cost, meaning that the
character is expected to pay the other 20%.
If they cannot pay, their possessions or their stored morph may be
seized in payment.
.PP
If a character violates their insurance policy by intentionally putting
themself in harm's way above the threat level at which the policy was
purchased, without first communicating with and rendering payment to the
insurer, the policy may be declared void.
If the leased morph dies under a voided policy and the character cannot
pay to replace it, their possessions and stored morph may be subject to
seizure.
.PP
Seizure takes different forms depending upon the local economy and legal
system.
In hypercorp space, it is a straightforward seizure of liquid assets,
including forced uploading if the character's morph is seized.
Elsewhere, the character is more likely to end up owing a lot of favors
or taking severe hits to their reputation, but they are unlikely to
undergo forced uploading or outright physical seizure of their morph.
.SS Identity
.PP
Given the nature of resleeving technologies, identity is a fluid concept
in \f[I]Eclipse Phase.\f[] Transhumans are used to the idea of
identifying people by how they look or even by their biometric data, but
this is no longer a certified method.
What you look like may drastically change from one day to the next.
You may see an olympian you recognize, but perhaps it's been awhile, so
you're no longer certain that it's the same person still in that morph.
If you're sleeved in a popular off\-the\-rack morph, there may be
hundreds of other cloned morphs that look exactly like you out
there\[em]perhaps useful if you desire to blend in.
Similarly security services can no longer rely on biometric
technologies.
Forensics may be able to identify an individual morph's presence at a
crime scene, but proving who was in that morph at the time is another
matter.
.PP
Identity is, of course, tied to ego, and various authorities have
instituted verification and security measures based on this.
Within the inner system, each ego is given an ID number, which is used
to validate their identity, citizenship, legal status, credit accounts,
licensing, etc.
This ego ID is verifiable by the person's brainwave patterns, which
remain the same even when resleeving.
When an ego uploads, the uploading service is required to incorporate
this ego ID into the person's backup/infomorph.
Likewise, when that person resleeves, the service handling the procedure
is required by law to verify the ego's ID before downloading The ego ID
is then hardcoded into the morph itself in the form of a nanotattoo on
the tip of the person's index finger.
This nanotat can be easily scanned at security checkpoints to verify
identity.
.PP
Though efficient, this system is far from perfect.
For one, ID record\-keeping is far from standardized and varies
drastically from habitat to habitat.
Most do not share records with each other unless they are part of the
same political alliance in order to protect their citizens' privacy.
For example, Lunar\-Lagrange Alliance stations do not share citizenship
ID data with the Planetary Consortium, though they do share with each
other.
On top of this, many identity records were lost during the Fall, a
situation that was undoubtedly exploited by those who preferred to erase
their past or adopt a new persona.
These all make for a situation where identity records are patchwork at
best.
Officials must also rely on the security of other habitats for ID
verification.
If a person egocasts to Nectar on Mars from Qing Long in the Martian
Trojans, and the Nectar officials have no record of this person, they
can only trust that the Qing Long officials did their job when verifying
the subject's ID and background.
To make matters worse, many autonomist habitats operate without identity
checks altogether.
Though some ID measures are still used, both to prevent reputation
system gaming and to be able to identify bodies in the case of death,
these uses are significantly more lax and few records are kept.
Therefore, when autonomists and the like egocast to habitats that
require ID, they are assigned a temporary ID for the duration of their
stay (and sometimes any future visits).
.SS Identity Verification
.PP
There are three ways to verify someone's identity: nanotat scan,
brainwave scan, and checking the cryptographic hash on a digital mind.
.SS Nanotat Scans
.PP
Special encoded nanobots are used to create a small nanotat on a
person's index finger.
These nanobots contain encoded information that includes their name and
identity, brainwave pattern, citizenship/legal status, credit account
number, insurance information, and licenses.
Depending on the local habitat laws, it may include other information
such as criminal history, travel history, restricted implants,
employment records, and so on.
This nanotat may be read by anyone with a special ID scanner that reads
the nanobot encoding.
ID nanotats include information on the company that did the resleeving,
so that the data may be accessed and verified with their records online.
The data on the nanotat is also cryptographically signed with the
company's public key, meaning that anyone who checks the data and the
signature online can tell if the data has been altered.
.SS Brainwave Scans
.PP
Brainwave scans are one of the few types of biometric prints that stay
with an ego no matter what morph it is in.
They are impractical for most security purposes as they require a scan
with a combination electroencephalogram and neuroimaging device,
referred to as a brainprint scanner, which takes approximately 5
minutes.
This device measures the subject's baseline brainwave pattern as well as
the subject's brainwave signature responses when they think certain
thoughts or sense certain patterns.
These scans are all but impossible to fool, however, barring hacking of
the brainprint scanner itself, and so are considered quite reliable.
For this reason they are occasionally used in high\-security facilities.
.PP
It is worth noting that infection by some variants of the Exsurgent
virus, notably the Watts\-Macleod strain (p.
367), sometimes alters a person's brainwave patterns, but not in every
case.
.SS Digital Code
.PP
Digital ID codes are often incorporated into backups and infomorphs.
Not only does this help identify who the backup belongs to, but it
serves as an electronic signature for verifying ID when the backup is to
be resleeved.
This digital code typically contains the same information as the nanotat
ID, and is signed with a cryptographic hash that makes it difficult to
forge and which can be verified online.
AIs and AGIs also feature such built\-in codes.
.SS Circumventing ID Checks
.PP
Firewall sentinels and clandestine agents often have a need to hide or
alter their identities.
While ID system are challenging, they are not insurmountable.
.SS Fake IDs
.PP
The easiest way to bypass security checks is to establish a fake ID.
Given the patchwork nature of identity records and the lack of any
centralized authority, this is not very difficult.
Numerous crime syndicates and even some autonomist groups maintain a
thriving ID fabrication business, often with complete histories and
medical covers for implants that might be restricted or illegal.
.PP
These IDs are usually registered with habitats that are either known
criminal havens, have autonomist sympathies or are isolated and remote.
Though the ID is actually verifiable and registered with these stations,
the potential shady origins of such IDs is known to most inner system
authorities and so the character may be exposed to extra scrutiny or
monitoring.
Fake IDs may be acquired that are registered with more respected
authorities but this often requires a much higher expense or connections
to hypercorp clandestine operations.
.PP
Black market darkcast and resleeving options offer fake IDs as a matter
of course.
.SS Altering Nanotat IDs
.PP
Special nanobot treatments may be manufactured to erase, rewrite, or
replace nanotat IDs.
Erasing a nanotat is easy, but not having one is a crime and immediate
grounds for suspicion in many habitats.
Rewriting a nanotat is also easy, though this means that the nanotat
will fail its authorization online unless the encryption has also been
cracked (p.
253).
Replacing a nanotat ID with a fake one is just as possible, and is part
of the process of acquiring a fake ID.
.SS Digital ID Tampering
.PP
Digital ID codes may also be tampered with, though like nanotat IDs this
will mean that the ID fails online verification unless the encryption is
also defeated (p.
253).
.SS Life In Space
.PP
Transhumanity is not just a spacefaring race, it is also largely
space\-dwelling.
While a substantial portion of transhumanity inhabits planetary bodies
like Mars, Luna, Venus, and the moons of the gas giants, the balance
live in a variety of space habitats, ranging from the old\-fashioned
O'Neill cylinders of the inner system to the Cole bubbles of the outer
system.
.SS Space Habitats
.PP
Space habitats come in many sizes and configurations from survivalist
outposts designed to support ten or fewer people to miniature worlds in
resource\-rich areas housing as many as ten million people.
In heavily settled regions of space, such as Martian orbit, habitats may
be integrated into local infrastructure, relying to some extent on
supply shipments from other orbital installations.
.PP
More commonly, especially in the outer system, habitats are independent
entities.
This usually means that in addition to the main space station, the
habitat is attended by a host of support structures, including zero\-g
factories, gas and volatiles refineries, foundries, defense satellites,
and mining bases.
.PP
Habitats\[em]especially large ones\[em]sometimes have visitors, as well.
Majors habitats are crossroads in space.
In addition to scheduled bulk freighter stops, they may have hangers\-on
such as scum barges, prospectors or out\-of\-work autonomous bot swarms.
.PP
Many habitats have some form of transportation network.
This is most common in large cylindrical habitats with centrifugal
gravity.
Common solutions for public transit include monorail trains, trams, and
dirigible skybuses.
Common personal transit options included bicycles, scooters,
motorcycles, and microlight aircraft, with larger vehicles being
uncommon and usually reserved for official use.
.PP
Most habitats with large interior spaces also use augmented reality
overlays to create consensual hallucinations of a sky and clouds, to
which most residents keep their AR channels tuned.
One would think that in space, talking about the weather would have
disappeared from transhumanity's repertoire of small talk, but the habit
persists\[em]only the weather discussed is usually virtual (if it's not
real \[lq]weather\[rq]\[em]solar flare activity and the like).
.SS Cluster Colony
.PP
Clusters are the most common form of microgravity habitat.
Clusters consist of networks of spherical or rectangular modules made of
light materials and connected by floatways.
Typically business and residential modules are clustered around arterial
floatways and infrastructure modules such as farms, power, and waste
recycling.
Limited artificial gravity areas may exists, frequently parks or other
public places and specialized modules like resleeving facilities (morphs
often keep better when stored in gravity).
Arterial floatways in large clusters may have \[lq]fast lanes\[rq] where
a constantly moving conveyor of grab\-loops speeds people along.
.PP
Clusters are most commonly found in volatile\-rich environments like the
Trojans and the ring systems of the gas giants (particularly Saturn).
Clusters are rare in the Jovian system because shielding a cluster of
individual modules rather than one large station from Jupiter's intense
magnetosphere is hideously inefficient.
.PP
Cluster colonies can have anywhere from 50 to 250,000 inhabitants.
.SS Cole Bubbles
.PP
Cole bubbles (or \[lq]bubbleworlds\[rq]) are found mostly in the main
asteroid belt, where the large nickel\-iron asteroids used to construct
them are abundant.
Bubbleworlds are less common in the Trojans and Greeks, where crusty ice
asteroids predominate.
A Cole bubble is similar in many respects to an O'Neill cylinder, but
there are no longitudinal windows.
Sunlight instead enters through axial mirror arrays.
The bubbleworld is also constructed very differently, using a large
solar array to heat a pocket of water inside of a metal asteroid so that
the metal expands.
Rotating the asteroid causes the malleable material to form a cylinder,
which is then capped off and the water drained.
The inside can then be pressurized, built out, and planted.
Cole bubbles can also be spun for gravity, according to the whims of the
inhabitants, though the gravity lowers as you near the poles of the
bubble, with zero gravity at the axis of rotation.
.PP
Cole bubbles are among the largest structures transhumanity has created
in space.
The largest Cole habitat, Extropia, has a population of 10 million.
.SS Hamilton Cylinders
.PP
Hamilton cylinders are a new technology.
There are only three fully operational Hamilton cylinders in the system,
but the design shows great promise and is likely to be widely adopted
over the coming period.
Hamilton cylinders are grown using a complex genomic algorithm that
orchestrates nanoscale building machines.
These nanobots build the habitat slowly over time, a process more like
growing than construction.
.PP
Similar to O'Neill cylinders and Cole bubbles, a Hamilton cylinder is a
cylindrical habitat rotating on its long axis to provide gravity Two of
the known Hamilton cylinders orbit Saturn in positions skimming the
rings near the Cassini division.
From this position, they can graze on silicates and volatiles using
harvester ships.
.PP
None of the currently\-operating Hamilton cylinders have grown to full
size yet, but estimates say they could each house up to 3 million
people.
.SS O'Neill Cylinders
.PP
Found mostly in the orbits of Earth, Luna, Venus, and Mars, O'Neill
cylinders were among transhumanity's first large space habitat designs
O'Neill cylinders are no longer built, having been replaced by more
efficient designs, but are still home to tens of millions of
transhumans.
O'Neill cylinders were constructed from metals mined on Luna or Mercury,
Lunar volatiles (including Lunar polar ice), and asteroidal silicates.
.PP
A typical O'Neill habitat is thirty\-five kilometers long, eight
kilometers in diameter, and rotates around its long axis at a speed
sufficient for centrifugal force to create one Earth gravity on the
inner wall of the cylinder.
Smaller cylinders exist, though these usually feature lower gravity
(typically Mars standard).
Cylinders are sometimes joined together, end\-to\-end, for extra long
habitats.
A spaceport is situated at one end on the rotational axis of the
cylinder (where there is no gravity).
Arrivals by space use a lift or microlight launch pad to get down to the
habitat floor.
.PP
The inside of an O'Neill cylinder has six alternating strips of ground
and window running from one cap of the cylinder to the other.
One narrow end of an O'Neill cylinder points toward the sun.
The opposite end is the mooring point for three immense reflectors
angled to reflect sunlight into the windows.
Smart materials coating the windows and reflectors prevent fluctuations
in solar activity from delivering too much heat.
The air inside the cylinder and its metal superstructure provide
radiation shielding.
.PP
The land in most O'Neill cylinders is one\-third agricultural (a
combination of food vats and high\-yield photosynthetic crops),
one\-third park land, and one\-third mixed use residential and business.
O'Neill habitats have a day and night cycle regulated by the position of
the external mirrors.
The business and residential sections of the cylinder usually alternate
with the park land over two of the strips of land; cropland usually
takes up the third.
Bridges cross the windows every kilometer or so, linking the land
strips.
The interior climate, the architectural style of the structures, and the
types of vegetation and fauna present vary with the tastes of the
habitats' designers.
.PP
Depending upon size, O'Neill cylinders can house from 25,000 to 2
million people.
.SS Tin Cans
.PP
Antique research stations and survivalist prospector outposts often fit
this description.
Tin can habitats are only a few notches up from the early 21st\-century
International Space Station.
Tin cans usually consist of one or more modules connected to solar
panels and other utilities by an open truss.
Deluxe models feature actual floatways or crawlways between modules,
while barebones setups require a vacsuit or vac\-resistant morph to go
from room to room.
Food growing capacity is severely limited and there may be no
farcasters, but fabricators are available, as well as mooring for
shuttles and perhaps prospecting craft.
.PP
Tin cans rarely house more than 50 people.
.SS Toruses
.PP
Interchangeably called toruses, toroids, donuts, and wheels, these
circular space habitats were a cheap alternative to the O'Neill cylinder
used for smaller installations.
Like O'Neill cylinders, toruses are seldom constructed anymore, but many
are still encountered in the inner system, particularly in Earth and
Lunar orbit.
.PP
A toroidal habitat looks like a donut 1 kilometer in diameter, rotating
on great spokes.
There is a zero\-g spaceport at the wheel's hub.
Visitors take a lift down one of the spokes to the level of the donut,
where rotation creates one Earth gravity.
.PP
The plan of toroidal habitats varies greatly, as many were designed for
specific scientific or military purposes and only later taken over as
habitats by entrepreneurs or squatters.
Many have a succession of decks in the donut.
Most of those designed for long\-term self\-sufficient habitation have
smart material\-covered glass windows for growing plants along much of
the inside surface of the torus.
Toroidal habitats equipped for farming normally face the sun in a
direction perpendicular to their rotational axis, but then use a slow
processional wobble of that axis to create a day/night cycle.
.PP
Toruses were usually built to accommodate small crews of 500 or fewer
people, though some larger ones exist, able to house 50,000.
A few rare double\-toruses also exist, like two large wheels spinning in
opposite directions, joined at the axis.
.SS Immigration And Customs
.PP
How characters gain entry to a habitat and what type of screening
they're likely to undergo depends upon how they arrive.
Some habitats are close to other settlements, while others are
physically isolated by the vast, empty distances of interplanetary
space.
.PP
Habitats in dense planetary systems receive most of their visitors via
conventional space travel.
Immigration and customs infrastructure is geared toward receiving
visitors via their spaceport, and the processing of arrivals is in most
ways analogous to a twentieth century airport.
Isolated habitats, on the other hand, tend to receive almost all of
their visitors via egocast.
.SS Physical Arrivals
.PP
Arrivals by spacecraft undergo, at minimum, an ego ID check, scans to
detect pathogens, hostile nanobots, explosives, or radiation, and an
inspection of their personal effects.
Some habitats go farther, including rigorous secondary screenings using
scout nanoswarms scans of all electronic systems for malware, and/or
aggressive interrogation of a fork of the subject.
Even autonomist enclaves enforce automated scans for anything that might
pose a danger to the habitat or any signs of hypercorp saboteur efforts.
.PP
Restricted goods vary according to local legalities.
Many habitats, particularly those controlled by autonomist or criminal
factions, allow personal weaponry as long as its nothing you can use to
blow a hole in the structure or indiscriminately kill dozens of people.
Others, notably the Jovian Republic and hypercorp stations, disallow
lethal weapons of all kinds, except for people who have acquired special
permits and authorization (sometimes available by bribing the right
people or pulling favors with rep).
Nonlethal weapons are generally allowed.
Other restricted items may include nanofabricators, nanoswarms, malware
and hacker software, drugs and narcoalgorithms, certain types of XP
recordings, covert operations tools, and so on.
Certain types of morphs may also be restricted, such as reapers, furies,
or uplifts.
.PP
Certain habitats may insist that visitors\[em]or at least the ones they
don't like the looks of\[em]submit to specific forms of monitoring or
surveillance for the duration of their stay.
This might include taggant nanoswarms, hosting a police AI in your mesh
inserts, or even physical tailing by an armed security drone.
Other stations will require that their visitors leave a fork as a form
of collateral at the door\[em]in case they commit a crime, the fork can
be interrogated.
.PP
Finally, though rare, some habitats go so far as to charge all visitors
an \[lq]air tax\[rq]\[em]a fee for using the station's publicly
available resources while they are present.
This is generally only common in isolated habitats with strained
resources, and is considered especially obnoxious by most autonomists.
.PP
Some syndicates run a good business in smuggling certain goods or even
people into habitats.
This is generally accomplished through bribed security personnel, but is
also sometimes handled as falsified credentials that will allow the
subject to breeze past security checks.
Such services are typically quite expensive.
.PP
For those hoping to gain quiet and unobserved access, there is always
the option of taking a spacewalk and trying to break in through an
unattended airlock.
Such attempts are quite often dangerous and futile, as most habitats
have dedicated sensor and security systems to monitor their exterior
surface and in particular any access points.
Still, it is a possibility for a resourceful team with a skilled hacker,
though armed sentry bots are a particular danger.
.SS Electronic Arrivals
.PP
Arrivals by egocast are sometimes interviewed by habitat authorities in
a simulspace before resleeving.
Depending upon the habitat's attitude toward civil rights, this process
can be relatively reasonable or quite invasive.
A minimal entry inspection includes an ID check, a brief interview with
a customs AI, and a review of the specs of the morph into which the
arriving ego plans to resleeve.
Habitats with draconian immigration measures may use harsh psychosurgery
interrogation techniques on suspect infomorphs.
Egocast backups have little recourse to avoid this treatment\[em]station
authorities can simply file them away in cold storage if they
choose\[em]so it is wise to investigate custom procedures before you
send yourself over.
.PP
Because many people, particularly autonomists and brinkers, don't
appreciate this kind of reception, various uploading services have
stepped in to provide pre\-customs resleeving for characters traveling
to habitats with suspect screening methods.
For often\-exorbitant fees, the traveler egocasts into an
extraterritorial substation close to their intended destination,
resleeves there, and then travels to their destination by rocket.
.PP
Various darkcast services, normally run by established crime syndicates,
sometimes offer an alternative method of egocasting in and possibly even
resleeving.
Darkcast services are quite expensive, however, and the character is at
the mercy of the syndicate operators In rare cases, some political
factions or even hypercorps might operate their own darkcast systems,
which a character with good networking skills might be able to take
advantage of.
.SS Space Travel
.PP
In some circumstances, characters will prefer to travel physically
through space rather than egocasting.
In \f[I]Eclipse Phase,\f[] spacecraft are primarily dealt with as a
setting environment rather than a vehicle/gear to use.
Spacecraft largely pilot themselves via the onboard AI.
Though characters can also take over with their Pilot: Spacecraft skill,
the situation rarely calls for it.
.SS Local Travel
.PP
In densely inhabited planetary systems such as Mars and Saturn, most
travel between cities, surface stations, and orbital habitats within
200,000 kilometers is by small hydrogen\-fueled (or sometimes
methane\-fueled) rockets.
This form of travel is incredibly cheap, very fast, and avoids the
occasional personality glitches that crop up during egocasting.
LOTVs (lander and orbital transfer vehicles, p.
348) are commonly used.
Spacecraft leaving a planetary body need to be able to generate enough
thrust to escape the gravity well (see \f[I]Escaping Gravity Wells,\f[]
p.
346).
.SS Distance Travel
.PP
For distances of 200,000 to 1.5 million kilometers, somewhat larger (and
more expensive) fusion\- and plasma\-drive craft make regular runs.
Nuclear electric ion drives were once used on some of these routes, but
the poor efficiency of these fission systems and the need for
radioactive heavy metal reaction mass means that they are almost never
used anymore.
Faster antimatter\-drive couriers are also commonly used.
These ships lack the thrust to escape from the gravity wells of large
planets or moons, so they station themselves in orbit and use smaller
ships (typically LOTVs) with higher thrust to transport people to and
from the planetary surface.
For distances beyond 1.5 million kilometers, almost everyone uses
egocasting
.SS Space Travel Basics
.PP
Spacecraft use various types of reaction drives (see \f[I]Spacecraft
Propulsion,\f[] p.
347), meaning that they burn fuel (reaction mass) and direct the heated
output in one direction, which pushes the spacecraft in the opposite
direction.
Travel over any major distance typically involves a period of
high\-acceleration burn for several hours at the beginning of the
flight, where up to half of the reaction mass is spent to drive up the
craft's velocity The ship then coasts for the majority of the flight at
that speed, until it approaches its destination, where it flips over and
burns an equal amount of reaction mass in the opposite direction to
decrease velocity.
Though some craft burn half their reaction mass to get up to the best
speed possible, this doesn't leave much room for additional maneuvering
or emergencies Many craft therefore only burn up to a quarter or a third
of their fuel in initial accelerations, so they have some to spare in
case they need it.
A few tricks can be used to save fuel and build speed, such as
slingshotting around the gravity wells of larger planets or aerobraking
in a planet's upper atmosphere.
Travel times between locations are constantly changing as various bodies
move in their orbits around the solar system.
Within a cluster or planetary system, travel takes a matter of hours.
Within the 286 inner system, travel can take days or weeks.
Travel to, from, or within the outer system can take much longer, and is
usually a matter of several months.
.PP
Most ships operate at zero\-g, except for a few larger craft that are
able to spin habitat modules for low gravity.
Periods of high\-acceleration also produce temporary gravity in a
downward direction, towards the burn.
.PP
Space is a valuable commodity on board spacecraft, so room is often
tight.
Sleeping and personal quarters are rarely bigger than large closets,
just enough room for a sleeping bag and personal effects.
Depending on the size of the craft, there may be a communal recreation
area.
The crew tend to only be busy at the beginning and end of a trip, when
they must deal with acceleration/deceleration and maneuvering around
other space traffic.
The rest of the trip they spend dealing with repairs or otherwise
killing time, often by accessing XP or VR simulations or playing AR
games.
While spacecraft have their own local mesh network, they are usually too
far to interact with the mesh networks of other habitats without
significant communications lag, so they must make do with their own
archive of entertainment options.
Many long\-haul ships are crewed by hibernoid morphs, who hunker down
for a long nap.
.SS Spaceship Combat
.PP
Combat in space tends to take place over long distances using massive
beam weapons, railguns, and missiles.
It also tends to be nasty, brutish, and short.
Significant damage to a vessel can cause atmospheric decompression,
killing any biomorph crew who aren't suited up and strapped down.
.PP
For the most part, it is recommended that space combat be treated as a
plot device, part of the background story that helps create drama and
tension, rather than an event that characters actively participate in.
This is not to say the characters cannot play a role in the combat, or
that their actions will have no effect on the outcome.
They may become involved in damage control, negotiate with hostile
forces, repel boarders, target weapons with Gunnery skill, stage a
mutiny, attempt to hack the networks of approaching vessels, escape out
the airlock, hide out while the pirates sack the ship, or similar
affairs.
It is recommended however, that gamemasters steer clear of space combat
situations that could easily lead to the whole team dying due to a few
bad dice rolls.
.SS Nanofabrication
.PP
In order to create an object in a nanofabricator (whether a cornucopia
machine, fabber, or maker; see p.
327), three things are needed: raw materials, blueprints and time.
.SS Raw Materials
.PP
Raw materials are generally easy to acquire, as most nanofabricators are
equipped with disassembler units that will break down just about
anything into its constituent molecules.
Feedstock may also be purchased (at a cost of Trivial).
Many habitats route their recycling and waste products directly into
disassemblers.
.SS Blueprints
.PP
Most nanofabricators are pre\-loaded with blueprints for general purpose
items: food, simple clothing, basic tools, etc.
Blueprints for other goods may be acquired in several ways:
.IP \[bu] 2
They may be purchased online (legally or on the black market).
.IP \[bu] 2
They may be found for free online (see below).
.IP \[bu] 2
They may be acquired with Rep, following the usual rules for social
networking (p.
285).
.IP \[bu] 2
They may stolen (usually by hacking a mesh site or a nanofabricator
containing such plans).
.IP \[bu] 2
They may be self\-programmed (see below).
.PP
Once the blueprints are acquired, they are simply loaded into the
nanofabricator.
.SS Open Source Blueprints
.PP
Blueprints for many goods may be found for free online, disseminated by
an active open source software movement.
The availability of such plans typically depends on the local mesh.
In autonomist habitats, a simple Research Test is likely to turn up the
open source blueprints you need (applying modifiers for unusual items).
In more restricted habitats, open source blueprints may be harder to
find, as they will be securely hidden from the prying eyes of the
authorities In this case, the character will need to use their Rep to
gain access, bribe a local hacker group, or do something similar.
.PP
Note that restricted nanofabricators may not accept open source
blueprints (see \f[I]Blueprint Restrictions\f[]).
.SS Blueprint Restrictions
.PP
Some nanofabricators are equipped with pre\-programmed restrictions not
to accept blueprints for restricted items (such as weapons) or
non\-licensed items (such as black market or open source blueprints).
These restrictions may be circumvented by hacking the nanofabricator and
re\-programming it, following normal hacking rules (p.
254).
.SS Programming Blueprints
.PP
A dedicated character may simply decide to program their own blueprints,
though this is a time\-consuming endeavor.
To do so, the character must make a Programming (Nanofabrication) Test
with a timeframe of one week per cost level of the item.
For example, a Trivial cost item takes 1 week, a Low cost item takes 2
weeks, a Moderate item 3 weeks, and so on.
Academics Nanotechnology skill or a skill appropriate to the object's
design may be used as a complementary skill (p.
173) for this test.
A fork or muse may also be assigned to such a programming task.
.SS Time
.PP
Once the raw materials and blueprints are in, most nanofabrication is
simply a matter of time.
The exact timeframe to create an object varies, but roughly approximates
1 hour per cost category of the item (1 hour for Trivial, 2 for Low, 3
for Moderate, etc.).
The gamemaster may feel free to modify this period as appropriate for
the object.
.SS The Programming Test
.PP
Nanofabrication is typically handled as a Programming Nanofabrication
Test.
In most cases, this can be treated as a Simple Success Test (p.
118), with a failed roll simply indicating that the item has some minor
imperfections, or perhaps took longer to make.
.PP
In some cases, the gamemaster may call for an actual Success Test,
meaning that failure is more of a possibility.
This should only be done for items that are exotic, extremely
complicated, or for which the blueprints are incomplete or otherwise
suspect.
This test can also be made if the raw materials are limited.
.PP
The character operating the nanofabricator can make this test or it can
be left up to the nanofabricator's built\-in AI.
Most such Such AIs have a Programming (Nanofabrication) skill of 30 (see
\f[I]AIs and\f[] \f[I]Muses,\f[] p.
331).

The conflict between market capitalism and other forms of economics is
one of transhumanity's last great culture wars, and it's still being
fought.
Transhumanity's expansion into the solar system created myriad
opportunities to experiment with new economic systems Many failed, but
the reputation economies of the outer system have proven both
utilitarian and robust in a way that no previous challenger to market
capitalism has managed.
.PP
The reputation economy, sometimes called the gift economy or open
economy, is one in which the material plenty created by nanofabrication
and the longevity granted by uploading and backups have removed
considerations of supply versus scarcity from the economic
equation\[em]destroying classical economics in the process.
.PP
The regimented societies of the inner system and the Jovian Junta have
used societal controls and careful regulation of the technologies of
abundance on their populations, thus keeping to a transitional economy
system that is largely an outgrowth of classical economics.
No one could get away with doing this in the outer system.
In the Trojans and Greeks, much of the belt, free Jupiter, and anywhere
outward from Saturn, the reputation economy rules.
.PP
How did this happen?
For one thing, money is a nuisance when you're an autonomous member of
an autonomous collective whose nearest three neighbors (each 100,000
kilometers away) are also autonomous collectives.
All of you are almost completely self\-sufficient in terms of material
resources.
You have a fleet of robots that harvest water, volatiles, reactor mass,
metals, and silicates.
You have a nanofabricator to make all of your small items, a community
factory for large ones, and a machine shop where you can build anything
else\[em]with help and advice from an AI with the combined knowledge and
experience of a top flight engineering team, if you even need it.
You grow your own food.
.PP
Money is for people who don't know how to take care of themselves.
Transhumanity is only a few decades away from being a mature Type I
Kardashev civilization, having largely mastered the material resources
of its own solar system.
A character from the outer system most likely finds the whole concept of
money an embarrassment.
.PP
However, material abundance hasn't eliminated the value of certain goods
and services.
A transhuman's lunch might be free, but innovative ideas, new designs,
health care, sex, and dirty work don't grow in fabricators.
What if you need gene therapy on your morph to grow infrared sensing
cells on your face?
How about someone to assassinate your renegade beta fork after she set
off a hallucinogen grenade at your gallery opening and kidnapped your
boyfriend?
What if you really need a spanking?
You call on your social network.
If your network is sufficiently deep and numerous, and your reputation
is good enough, someone will help you out.
.PP
In the inner system, the reputation economy doesn't replace money for
the exchange of goods and services, but it does hold sway over the
network of favors and influence.
Calling on contacts, getting information, and making sure you're in the
best place to see and be seen all involve calling on your social
network.
.SS Social Networks
.PP
Social networks represent the people you know, and the people they know,
and so on.
It starts with your friends and family, spreads out to your co\-workers,
neighbors, and colleagues, and expands all the way out to your
acquaintances, from the neo\-hominid waitron at your favorite cafe to
the sylph you flirt with at the club.
In the always\-online, fully\-meshed universe of \f[I]Eclipse Phase,\f[]
this goes even further, encompassing all of the people you've linked to
via social mesh networks, everyone who watches your
blog/lifelog/updates, and everyone you interact with on various mesh
forums.
Now add in the friend\-of\-a\-friend factor, and everyone has an
impressive ability to reach out to people they know, people they sort of
know, and people you don't know but who are somehow linked to you in one
degree or another.
.PP
Of course, social networks are not homogeneous.
Among the ever\-diversifying ranks of transhumanity, there is a tendency
to coalesce around various shared characteristics, whether those be
cultural background, personal interests, professional ties, local
connections, political affiliations, subcultural obsessions, or simply
common interest from being part of the same subspecies clade.
The social network of an info\-anarchist hacker is likely to bear little
resemblance to that of a hypercorp socialite or an isolate brinker.
Nevertheless social networks quite frequently overlap, often in
unexpected and interesting ways.
Most people can be considered members of several different types of
social networks.
This overlap is what links disparate groupings of transhumans together.
.SS Networking
.PP
Just being connected, of course, doesn't mean you have several thousand
idle transhumans at your beck and call.
If you hope to gather the latest gossip, get advice from an expert, find
someone who can fix your problems acquire a piece of gray market tech,
or spread a meme, you need to know both \f[I]who\f[] to talk to in that
social network and \f[I]how\f[] to go about getting what you need,
especially if you hope to keep things quiet and not raise any flags.
.PP
This is where your Networking: [Field] skills come in (p.
182).
Networking represents your ability to maneuver through this web of
personal and impersonal connections to find who and what you need.
This could be handled by word\-of\-mouth, posting the right queries in
the right places on the mesh, monitoring the right personal profiles and
forums, harnessing the power of the mob with crowdsourcing, or any
number of similar creative tactics.
.PP
Each field you have in Networking represents a particular network
grouping, a common interest that ties people together.
Most of these fields are based on factions (Autonomists, Hypercorp,
etc.) and tie into a special reputation network (see the Reputation
Networks table, p.
287).
At the gamemaster's discretion other groupings of people could be
connected through these skills and rep systems.
For example, artists and journalists of all stripes can fall under the
Networking: Media skill and f\-rep, no matter if they are autonomist or
hypercorp.
Likewise, being a diverse group, brinkers do not universally fall into
any of the categories, and are instead spread out between them.
If the gamemaster and players agree, other Networking fields and rep
networks may be added, representing other spheres of interest, such as
AR Games, Sports, Slash Fiction, etc.
.PP
The exact uses for which you may exploit your social networks are noted
below.
While in some cases the defining element is who you know and how good
you are at reaching out to them, in others the defining element is how
known \f[I]you\f[] are.
You might be connected to thousands of people, but if you don't have
clout, your efforts to make use of these connections is limited.
This is where Reputation comes into play.
.SS Reputation
.PP
Reputation is a measurement of your social currency.
In the gift economies of the outer system, social reputation has
effectively replaced money.
Unlike credit, however, reputation is far more stable.
.PP
Within \f[I]Eclipse Phase,\f[] reputation scores are facilitated by
online social networks.
Almost everyone is a member of one or more of these reputation networks.
It is a trivial matter to ping the current Rep score and history of
someone you are dealing with\[em]your muse often does this
automatically, marking an entoptic Rep score badge on anyone with whom
you interact, updated in real time, so you will see if they suddenly
take a hit or become popular.
The 7 most common networks are noted on the Reputation Networks table.
Gamemasters and characters may decide to add others appropriate to their
game.
You purchase a Rep score in one or more of these networks during
character creation.
Rep scores are rated between 0 and 99, just like skills.
These ratings determine your ability to acquire goods, services, and
information and favors, as noted below.
These scores may be raised or lowered during game play according to your
character's actions.
.SS Using Networks And Rep
.PP
In game terms, you take advantage of your connections and personal cred
every time you need a \f[I]favor.\f[] A favor is broadly defined as
anything you try to get via your social networks, whether that be
information, aid, goods, and so on.
Different types of favors are described under \f[I]Favors,\f[] p.
289.
.SS The Networking Test
.PP
To pursue a favor, you start by looking around.
This calls for a Networking Test to determine if you can find the
person, people, or information you need.
This represents talking to people you know, spreading the word to people
they know, posting queries to the social network at large, digging
through various profiles, chat rooms, etc.
to find someone who might help you out, and so on.
Networking Tests are subject to modifiers for the level of the favor
(see below), the amount the character is trying to keep quiet about the
request (see below), and any other factors noted on the Networking
Modifiers table or determined by the gamemaster.
Networking Tests are Task Actions\[em]it takes time to call in favors or
track down information.
The timeframe depends on the level of favor, as noted on the Favors
table, p.
289.

.SS Favor Levels And Modifiers
.PP
Rep scores are broken down into five levels, reflecting your standing
within that community.
Every 20 points of Rep equals one level.
See the Reputation Levels table for a breakdown.
.PP
Likewise, favors are also broken down into five levels, rated from
Trivial to Scarce (see \f[I]Favors,\f[] p.
289, for specific examples).
The standard level of favor you can expect to get from a social network
is based on your level of Rep in that network.
If you want to pursue a favor above your level, you can do so, but you
will suffer a negative modifier on your Networking Test.
This reflects that someone with low standing has a hard time getting
people to go out of their way for them.
Similarly, if you pursue a favor below your level, you receive a
positive modifier to your Networking Test, reflecting that your prestige
makes it easier to acquire minor things that you need.
For each level the favor falls under or above your Rep score level,
apply a + or \[en]10 modifier, as appropriate.

Jaqui's on a scum barge and she needs to get a hold of a weapon fast.
She has a specific weapon in mind, but it's pricey\[em]its cost is High.
She decides her best approach is to try talking to the scum on the ship
to try and find someone who can lend or sell her such a weapon, using
her \@\-rep and her Networking: Autonomist skill of 50.
Acquiring a High cost item counts as a Level 4 High favor (see
Acquire/Unloads Goods, p.
289).
Jaqui's \@\-rep is 53, which is only Level 3.
Since the favor is one level higher than her rep level, she suffers a
\[en]10 modifier on her Networking Test.
Jaqui must roll a 40 or less (50 \[en] 10) to find a weapon supplier.
.RE
.SS Paying/Exchanging For Favors
.PP
Favors don't necessarily come for free.
Depending on what you're after, you may also need to exchange for it.
.PP
In the capitalist and transitional economies of the inner system and
Jovian Junta, you may need to buy the goods or services you are after
with credit.
Even information might be paid for by bribing the right person.
Once spent, that credit is gone until you earn more.
.PP
In the anarchistic reputation economies of the outer system, you can get
what you need for free.
In this case, you are acquiring goods and services based on the strength
of your reputation.
.RS
.PP
Jaqui rolls a 39\[em]she makes it! After posting some public notices on
the scum social network (she's not worried about legalities or hiding
what she's doing\[em]this is a scum ship after all), she gets directed
to a weapons dealer with a good rep.
While a scum arms merchant normally sells their wares for credit, Jaqui
is scum herself, so she's able to use her scum community standing and
get the weapon for free.
This uses up a High favor, however.
.RE
.SS The Limits Of Reputation
.PP
Even in the gift economies, reputation only gets you so far.
There are limits to how often you can ask for help before you start
coming across as pushy or a leech.
In game terms, this is expressed as a \f[I]refresh rate\f[]\[em]the
amount of time you must wait to pass before you can seek out a favor of
that level again without seeming demanding.
Refresh rates are noted on the Favors table (p.
289).
.PP
If you need to seek another favor before the refresh rate has expired,
you have two choices.
You can expend a higher level favor instead, keeping in mind that higher
level favors refresh more slowly.
Alternatively you can burn reputation (see below).
.RS
.PP
Now that Jaqui's got her weapon, she needs another favor\[em]she needs
to find someone who doesn't want to be found.
The person she's after is scum, so once again she turns to the scum for
help.
The gamemaster decides that this is another Level 4 favor (see Acquire
Information, p.
291).
Once again, with her Networking: Autonomist of 50 and Level 3 rep, she
must roll a 40 or less.
She gets a 21, and finds someone who has the information she needs.
Jaqui now has a choice.
To get this information, she either needs to pay the person in credits
(a High cost) or she she needs to expend another Level 4 favor.
She's low on money, so she decides to use her rep again.
Level 4 favors only refresh once a month, though, and Jaqui used her
last one just a few hours ago.
Her only choice is to expend a higher favor, so she expends a Level 5 to
get the intel she needs.
.RE
.SS Burning Reputation
.PP
In some cases, getting what you need may be more important than not
stepping on people's tentacles.
In situations of dire need, you can \f[I]burn\f[] some of your Rep score
to get the job done, meaning that you exchange a loss of Rep for a shot
at a favor.
This reflects that you are pushing the bounds of how far people are
willing to go for you.
While you still might get what you need, your online reputation rating
takes a hit as people flag you for being needy.
.PP
There are two reasons to burn Rep score.
The first is to get a bonus on your Networking Test.
This indicates that you are pulling strings and calling in markers to
get the favor you're after.
This is particularly useful when you are trying to obtain a favor that's
of a level higher than your Rep, but abuse it too often and you will
soon have no social standing at all.
Every point of Rep you burn gives you an equivalent positive modifier on
the Networking Test, up to a maximum of +30.
.PP
The second option is to burn Rep to seek a favor before it has
refreshed.
This reflects that you are asking for too much in a short period.
The amount of Rep you must burn in this case depends on the level of
favor you are seeking, as noted on the Favors table (p.
289).
.RS
.PP
Jaqui's got her weapon and her target's whereabouts, but she needs one
more thing: a hacker.
She needs someone who can open some doors and defeat some security
systems so she can get to the target she's after in his hideout.
Since she's on a scum barge, Jaqui feels that, once again, her best
option is to work her scum contacts.
The gamemaster determines that this will be another Level 4 favor.
Rolling against a target number of 40 again, she gets a 13\[em]her luck
is holding.
She finds a hacker, but now she needs to make an exchange for their
services.
Once again she decides not to spend credit and use her \@\-rep instead.
Jaqui's already used up both her Level 4 and Level 5 \@\-rep favors,
though, so she has no choice but to burn reputation.
A Level 4 favor costs 10 Rep to burn.
Jaqui spends it, sending her \@\-rep from 53 to 43\[em]she's been
pulling in a lot of big favors in a short amount of time, and her
friends and acquaintances are expressing their annoyance by lowering her
social standing.
.RE
.SS Keeping Quiet
.PP
The problem with using social networks for favors is that you end up
letting lots of other people know what you're up to.
When you're involved in a clandestine operation, that could be exactly
what you \f[I]don't\f[] want.
The only way to diminish this is to take your requests to trusted
friends and ask them to keep quiet, but this diminishes the pool of
people at your disposal.
In game terms, you can try to keep word of what you're doing quiet, but
this makes it harder to get what you need.
For every negative modifier you apply to your Networking Test, the same
negative modifier applies to anyone making a Networking Test to find out
what you're up to.
.RS
.PP
Revisiting one of our previous examples, we go back to the point where
Jaqui was trying to ascertain someone's hideout location.
Because the person she's after is scum, they're on a scum ship, and
Jaqui is using her Networking: Autonomist skill to find them, there's a
good chance that if she starts asking around to everyone, word might
trickle back to the person she's after.
She doesn't want them to know she's on their tail, though, so she
decides to make her inquiries more discreet.
She applies a \[en]20 modifier to her Networking Test, which lowers her
target number from 40 to 20.
As noted before, she rolls a 21, which is a failure.
She spends a Moxie point to flip the roll, though, making it a 12\[em]a
success.
Because Jaqui took that \[en]20 hit, representing the fact that she was
keeping her research quiet, her target will suffer a \[en]20 modifier
when he makes his Networking Test to see if he gets word that someone is
asking around about his hideout.
.RE
.SS Favors
.PP
Creative players can undoubtedly come up with many uses for their social
networks, but a few of the more common are detailed here.
Gamemasters should use their discretion as to how much roleplaying
interaction and Networking Tests are included in using a social network.
For normal goods, straightforward information queries, or small favors,
neither dice rolling nor roleplaying may be required For major requests,
interactions with contacts, and mission assistance, dice rolls and/or
roleplaying interaction with contacts from the social network should
usually occur.
Gamemasters may wish to keep track of the NPC contacts in each
character's social networks and make them recurring characters.

.SS Reputation And Identity
.PP
It is important to note that reputation is closely tied to identity.
If you are undercover and using a fake ID, you can't really call on your
Rep score without giving yourself away.
As a result, many people using false identities end up building up a
separate set of Rep scores for their alter ego.
Note that since many social network interactions take place online, it
is possible for someone to secretly make use of their real identity
while masquerading as someone else, as long as they're careful about it.
If anyone happens to be spying on their activity via the mesh, they
stand a chance of being found out.

Firewall sentinels make a regular habit of being in places where they
are not supposed to be and bringing things with them that others would
prefer they not have.
Security has a different character post\-Fall than in the 21st century.
Due to hyper\-abundance, physical security measures such as locks,
doors, and walls are less important than in the past to common citizens.
People don't worry about theft as much as in the past because most items
can be replaced by a nanofabricator.
The items that do tend to engender this type of security are
irreplaceable or rare items such as artifacts of Earth.
.PP
Post\-Fall physical security focuses heavily on
surveillance\[em]identifying intruders and tracking them so that they
can be interdicted by transhuman or robotic defenders.
Surveillance is more effective than in pre\-Fall societies because AIs
with near\-human faculties of pattern recognition and indentured
infomorphs can be employed to monitor surveillance data.
.PP
The emphasis on surveillance results from the ease with which most
material barriers can be breached by high\-powered hand weaponry and
devices like the covert operations tool (p.
315).
However, physical barriers designed to actively resist intruders by
healing themselves or attacking tools used to damage them are used at
key points in secure installations.
Such barriers are typically very expensive and so are used sparingly.
.PP
Transhuman, animal, and infolife defenders are cornerstones of most
security systems.
The availability of a huge pool of infomorph labor to guard facilities
means that someone is always on duty, whether as part of the
surveillance system or in a robotic shell.
.SS Access Control
.PP
The first step in any security system is simply to enact measure to keep
unwanted people out.
At a basic level this involves walls, locks, fencing, defensive
landscaping security lighting, and entoptic warnings.
.PP
Barriers of different sorts present an obstacle that must be cut through
or blown apart in order to defeat.
Barriers are treated just like other inanimate objects for purposes of
attack sand damage; see \f[I]Ob\-\f[] \f[I]jects and Structures,\f[] p.
202.
.SS Bug Zappers
.PP
Bug zappers create minute EMP pulses that are harmless to most
electronic equipment and implants but wreak havoc on nanobot swarms,
microbugs, and specks.
Bug zappers are generally applied to surfaces, and as such they only
destroy floating/flying swarms or specks if they land.
In areas with heavily shielded electronics, they may be installed to
destroy targets in an entire room.
A zapper instantly destroys all free\-crawling or flying nanobots and
specks in a room when it goes off, but transhuman flesh is sufficient to
prevent it destroying medichines or other implanted nanobots.
Infiltrators trying to gather data in areas protected by zappers
generally resort to going around them or trying to plant macroscale
devices.
.SS Electronic Locks
.PP
Electronic locks (e\-locks) are commonly used as a means of maintaining
privacy.
They are easy to defeat, however, and so are rarely used in very secure
areas.
E\-locks have several advantages over old\-fashioned mechanical locks.
Different users can have different authentication methods, they can log
all events (entry, exit, failed authentications), and they can be
connected (usually hardwired but sometimes encrypted wireless) to
security systems for remote control and alarm triggering.
.PP
E\-locks use one of several authentication systems, or sometimes a
combination of systems:
.PP
\f[B]Biometric:\f[] The lock scans one or more of the user's biometric
prints.
Common biometrics include DNA, facial thermographic, fingerprint, gait,
hand veins, iris, keystroke, odor, palm, retinal, and voice prints.
.PP
\f[B]Keypad:\f[] This is an alphanumeric keypad upon which users enter a
specific code.
Different users can have different codes.
.PP
\f[B]Token:\f[] Authorized users must carry some sort of physical token
that interacts with the lock to open the door, such as a keycard,
electronic key, etc.
.PP
\f[B]Wireless Code:\f[] Users must emit a cryptographic code via
near\-proximity wireless signal.
.PP
Though various technologies exist to defeat each of these systems, there
are three methods that work against almost all e\-locks.
The first is use of a covert operations tool (p.
315), which infiltrates a lock with nanobots that swarm in and engage
the electronic mechanism.
The drawback to using a COT is that its use is immediately logged by the
e\-lock and an alarm is triggered.
Some e\-locks are equipped with guardian nanoswarms (p.
329) to defeat COTs, but the COT nanobots usually manage to open the
lock before the guardians eat them.
.PP
The second method is to hack the e\-lock.
Most e\-locks are slaved to a security system, so this often means
intruding into the security system and then opening the lock from
within.
This can be difficult, however, especially if the security system is
wirelessly isolated or hardwired.
The advantage is that, if done right, all evidence of the lock being
opened can be erased.
The third method is to physically open and manipulate the lock.
This requires first opening the lock's case and then triggering the lock
mechanism to open the door.
Both of these are handled as separate Hardware: Electronics Task Actions
with a timeframe of 1 minute each.
In addition, most e\-locks have anti\-tamper circuits that will set off
an alarm if the attacker does not achieve an Excellent Success when
opening the case.
.SS Lockbots
.PP
The 21st century saw a move from mechanical locks to e\-locks and other
largely electronic locking mechanisms.
These devices worked well for about 50 years, until electronic
infiltration capabilities rendered them largely useless.
The more recent development of lockbots has more in common with their
early mechanical forebears.
They are unique, expensive, artisan items.
.PP
A typical lockbot is heavily integrated with the portal and barrier it
protects.
Lockbots usually include an AI or indentured infomorph, self\-healing
materials (treat as a self\-healing barrier), and a swarm of guardian
nanobots (p.
329).
A lockbot monitors its surroundings and has visual recognition software
that knows what its users and its keys look like (Perception skill 40).
Picking a lockbot is thus incredibly difficult, because it will shut its
orifice and not accept a key that doesn't look right or that comes from
an unrecognized user.
Unfamiliar nanobots trying to enter the orifice are targeted and
destroyed by the guardian nanobots.
Finally, external tools used to harm the portal or the lock will be
attacked by fractal appendages extruded from the portal surface or the
lock itself.
These appendages have a range of 1 meter, attack with skill of 40, and
inflict 1d10 +2 DV.
.PP
Lockbots are generally immune to being hacked because, for security,
they aren't connected to the mesh.
If attacked, however, lockbots are programmed to send out an alarm
signal via the mesh.
.PP
There are several ways to defeat a lockbot.
One is to get a copy or image of the key and then forge a copy (using
nanofabrication).
Another is to attack the lockbot or the portal it guards with so much
force that the lockbot is unable to repair it (usually using ranged
weapons, as anything within a meter of a lockbot may be
counterattacked).
A third is to somehow image the cavity beyond the lockbot's orifice
without the imaging device being destroyed and to then forge the key.
All of these are difficult and time\-consuming processes.
.PP
Some lockbots have the ability to destroy what they're protecting.
For example, lockbots are a common protection for the physical
interfaces to hardwired networks.
If the lockbot is compromised, it may, as a last resort, destroy the
interface it was protecting.
.SS Portal Denial System
.PP
Installed in corridors or doorways, this is essentially a laser trap
device.
When an unauthorized person enters the portal denial system's area, it
uses lasers to create a grid of plasma channels that are used to deliver
a powerful electric current to the target.
This system has both lethal and nonlethal settings.
.PP
\f[B]Nonlethal:\f[] 1d10 DV + shock (p.
204)
.PP
\f[B]Lethal:\f[] 2d10 +5 DV
.SS Self\-Healing Barriers
.PP
Walls and doors that are able to rapidly repair themselves are sometimes
found in high security installations These barriers are made of
materials that automatically expand to \[lq]heal\[rq] small holes and
that are equipped with nanosystems that slowly repair larger amounts of
damage.
The best of these barriers do no more than slow down the most determined
assailants, but in combination with surveillance systems they are a
nuisance to invaders and can slow down attempts to flee the scene.
.PP
Self\-healing barriers heal any single source of damage that is less
than 5 points of damage almost immediately, sealing the hole in 1 Action
Turn.
They will also seal the holes inflicted by a covert ops tool (p.
315) in the same time period.
Additionally, these barriers repair larger themselves at the rate of
1d10 damage per 2 hours; once all damage is fixed any wounds are
repaired at the rate of 1 per day.
Damage of 3 wounds or more may not be repaired by self\-healing.
.SS Slippery Walls
.PP
On planetary surfaces, high walls and fences are still common as a first
line of defense against interlopers Slippery walls are surface treated
with the slip chemical (p.
323), creating a virtually frictionless surface that is exceptionally
difficult to climb.
.SS Wireless Inhibitors
.PP
Wireless inhibitors are simple paint jobs or construction materials that
block radio signals.
They are used to create a contained area in which a wireless network may
operate freely without worry that the signals will escape out of the
area, where they can be intercepted.
Wireless inhibitors allow the convenience of using wireless links within
a secure area rather than the clumsier hardwired connections.
If an intruder manages to gain access inside the area, however, they can
intercept, sniff, and hack wireless devices as normal.
.SS Detection And Surveillance
.PP
Should security measures fail to keep an intruder out, the second step
is to detect an interloper and track their activity.
.SS Nanotagging
.PP
A lot of post\-Fall security centers not around keeping people out of
private spaces, but tracking them after they come and go.
What little privacy transhumans have, they cherish.
Trespassing is a worse offense than theft in many places.
.PP
A room protected by a taggant nanoswarm (p.
329) usually has two or more hives, one each at floor and ceiling level
(if in gravity; on the opposite side of the room if in microgravity)
that generate and recycle nanobots.
The taggants emerge from one hive, float through the room, and then
return to the other for recharging and reuse.
A feed line usually connects the hives so that they can share materials
and power.
.PP
Anyone passing through the room is likely to be dosed with taggant
nanobots.
Once they lose proximity to the rest of the hive, they hide and
periodically broadcast pulsed transmissions meant to give their position
to pursuers or investigators.
Some may drop off in clusters to form a breadcrumb trail to the
interloper.
.SS Sensors
.PP
Any of the various sensors described in the \f[I]Gear\f[] chapter (p.
294) may be deployed within a facility to monitor and record the passage
of personnel, both authorized and not.
These sensors are typically slaved to the facility's security network
and closely monitored by security AIs, meaning they are vulnerable to
hacking and possibly jamming.
A few other sensor types deserve mention here:
.PP
\f[B]Chemical Sniffers:\f[] The chem sniffer described on p.
311 can also be set to detect the carbon dioxide exhaled in transhuman
breaths.
This is useful for detecting intruding biomorphs in areas that are
abandoned/off\-limits.
.PP
\f[B]Electrical Sensors:\f[] Electrical sensors can be set in portals to
detect a biomorph's electromagnetic field in addition to the electrical
fields of synthmorphs.
.PP
\f[B]Heartbeat Sensors:\f[] These sensitive sensors detect the vibration
caused by transhuman heart beats.
They can even be used to detect the heartbeats of passengers inside a
large vehicle.
.PP
\f[B]Seismic Sensors:\f[] Embedded in flooring, these sensors pick up
the pressure and vibration of weight and movement.
.SS Weapon Scanners
.PP
Weapon scanners come in several varieties, including those that look for
the rare elements used in extremely destructive weapons such as nukes,
those that attempt to locate personal weaponry, and those that look for
detection taggants.
.PP
Rare element scanners are nearly flawless and are ubiquitous in habitat
customs and spaceports.
The only way to circumvent them is to find an alternate route into the
protected area.
.PP
Personal weapon scanners can monitor a specific area, such as a small
room or doorway.
They use a number of sensing systems to detect and identify weapons and
other dangerous objects, including chemical sniffers and
radar/terahertz/infrared/x\-ray/ultrasound imaging.
They can detect the following items and substances:
.IP \[bu] 2
Metal used in kinetic weapons, seekers, and flechette weapons
.IP \[bu] 2
Devices with onboard hives of metallic nano\- bots (e.g., covert
operations tools, spindles)
.IP \[bu] 2
Magnetic elements in plasma guns and railguns
.IP \[bu] 2
Propellant from firearms ammunition and seekers (\[en]30 to conceal)
.IP \[bu] 2
Chemical fuels used in torch spray weapons (\[en]30 to conceal)
.IP \[bu] 2
All explosives and grenades by their chemical particulate emissions
(\[en]30 to conceal)
.IP \[bu] 2
Poisons and bioagents in flechette weapons
.IP \[bu] 2
Any weapon or device larger than palm size (using sound waves and shape
recognition)
.PP
Characters trying to sneak weapons and gear past personal weapon
scanners must make a Palming Test (if concealing) or an Infiltration
Test (if somehow maneuvering around without notice).
This is opposed by a Perception Test from the character or AI manning
the sensor system.
.SS Wireless Scanning
.PP
Some high\-security areas will intentionally monitor for wireless radio
signals originating within their area as a way of detecting intruders by
their communications emissions.
These signals can even be used to track the intruder's location via
triangulation and other means (see \f[I]Physical Tracking,\f[] p.
251).
To bypass wireless detection systems covert operatives can use
line\-of\-sight laser links (p.
313) for communication or touch\-based skinlinks (p.
309).
.SS Active Countermeasures
.PP
When all else fails, active countermeasures may be deployed against
intruders.
While live transhuman guards are sometimes used, robotic sentries are
more common, typically AI\-driven synthmorphs such as synths,
slitheroids, arachnoids, or reapers, with guardian angels (p.
346) providing air support.
Occasionally AI\-operated gun emplacements\[em]armored turrets that pop
out of walls and ceilings\[em]are also applied.
In some circumstances, these shells are teleoperated or even jammed by
transhuman security.
.PP
Additional countermeasures brought to bear will depend on the facility
in question.
Some sites will engage in active jamming, to deny the intruders any
communication.
Others will deploy hostile nanoswarms and even chemical weapons.
