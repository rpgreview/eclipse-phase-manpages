.TH Gear "Eclipse Phase"

The accelerated technological levels of \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] enable a number of devices for personal enhancement, survival, and other uses.

.SH Equipment rules

The following rules apply to all technological items in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[].

.SS Acquiring gear

During character creation, players purchase gear for their characters using the credits they have during the character creation process.
Once play begins, however, characters must obtain any equipment they need the usual way: by buying, borrowing, making, or stealing it.

In the inner system, hypercorp, and Jovian Republic settlements \[em] and other places where capitalism still reigns \[em] gear acquisition is simply a matter of finding a seller and buying it.
Each item has a listed cost, from Trivial to Expensive, as noted on the Gear Costs table.
Due to local availability of resources, supply and demand, and legalities, these listed costs are meant to be approximations.
When no other factors apply, the listed Average Cost for that category can be used.
Otherwise the gamemaster should modify the item's worth as they see fit, according to local economic factors, while still keeping it within that cost category range.
The Cost Modifiers table lists out some suggested changes to an item's cost, but these are simply recommendations, and can be ignored or followed as the gamemaster deems fit.
The exact local conditions are largely up to the gamemaster to determine, as best fits their game.

In some circumstances, characters may attempt to haggle over gear prices.
This is best handled as roleplaying, but the gamemaster may also call for an Opposed Persuasion Test (or possibly an Intimidation Test).
The character who wins may increase or reduce the price by 10% per 10 points of MoS.

In the outer system, anarchist, Titanian, scum, and other habitats that use the reputation economy, characters must rely on their rep scores to acquire the goods and services they need.
The mechanics for this are covered under \f[I]Reputation and Social Networks\f[], p. 285.

Characters are of course free to get their hands on equipment by any other means they devise \[em] con schemes, borrowing from friends, and outright theft, with all of the appropriate tests and consequences.
In some cases, acquiring gear may be an adventure unto itself.

\fBFabricating gear\fR

.RS 1
Thanks to nanofabrication technology, characters may also create their own equipment using cornucopia machines and similar nanofab devices (p. 327).
The character must have the appropriate blueprints to do so, whether they come with the fabber, are bought legitimately or on the black market, acquired with rep, or found online.
Characters may also code their own blueprint desires, using the Programming: Nanofabrication skill.

.RE
.SS Gear modifiers

In the technological future, gear is a necessity.
In many cases, use of equipment provides no bonuses, it simply allows a character to perform a task they would otherwise be unable to do.
For example, it is impossible to pick a mechanical lock without lockpick or some sort of tool.

In other cases, however, gear provides a bonus to the task at hand.
Climbing a wall may be possible without tools, but if you happen to have gecko gloves or other climbing gear, it's going to be a lot easier.
The specific modifier applied is usually noted in the gear item's description, typically ranging from +10 to +30.

\fBGear quality\fR

.RS 1
In both of the situations above, it is possible to have items that are of either exceptional or inferior quality, with corresponding positive or negative modifiers.
The gear may be well\-crafted, state\-of\-the\-art, cutting\-edge experimental, or simply top\-of\-the\-line, applying an additional +10 to +30.
Or it may be outdated, shoddy, or in disrepair, inflicting a \-10 to \-30 modifier (in some cases canceling out the basic gear bonus).

.RE
\fBGear sizes\fR

.RS 1
On occasion, you'll need to know how small or large a certain piece of equipment is.
Though this is largely something the gamemaster can wing on the fly using common sense, we've listed sizes for many gear items that are unusual or so futuristic that the average player may not have a feel for what dimensions the tech likely is.
These size categories are listed on the Gear Sizes table (p. 297).
These sizes should be considered approximations, as depending on the manufacturer and process, some items may be smaller or larger than similar items.
It is also important to keep in mind that as technology advances, the size and components of various equipment items shrink, so when in doubt, go with smaller.

.RE
\fBMass and encumbrance\fR

.RS 1
A character who is carrying too much gear should be slowed down, suffering negative modifiers both to their movement rates and their skill tests.
Rather than micromanaging the weights of individual pieces of equipment, however, this matter is largely left to the gamemaster's discretion,
using common sense.
If a character loads up beyond reason, apply modifiers as seem appropriate.
The gamemaster should, however, keep in mind that many of the manufacturing materials used in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] allow for items that are much lighter than current standards without any loss of durability or function (see \f[I]Future Materials\f[], p. 298).
Likewise, characters in low or microgravity environments can carry much larger loads.

.RE
\fBConcealing gear\fR

.RS 1
Characters may attempt to conceal items on their person, hoping at least to hide them from casual notice if not an intensive search.
To determine how effectively the character conceals the equipment, make a Palming Test and note the MoS (the gamemaster may wish to roll this secretly).
Whenever another character has a chance to notice the concealed item, they must succeed in a Perception Test and achieve a higher MoS than was scored on the Palming Test.
The gamemaster should apply modifiers to both tests as appropriate.
For example, concealing a large item like a sword would be difficult (\-30), whereas wearing concealing clothing like a longcoat or multi\-pocketed jumpsuit would help (+20).
Likewise, a character who is not actively looking is less likely to notice the hidden gear (\-30), whereas someone who conducts a physical search (+30) or who has enhanced vision to pierce protective layers will fare better.

.RE
.SS Design and fashion

Many objects in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] closely resemble their early 21st century equivalents \[em] a bottle of soda is still a transparent container holding a brightly colored liquid, clothing is obviously something you wear, and a knife still consists of a blade and a handle.
The materials, processes, and mindsets that go into making them, however, are quite different.
To start, very few items look have a uniform, mass\-produced look, even if they were.
The procedures of minifacturing and nanofabrication allow every individual item to be manufactured with a unique (or at least different) look.
In areas with anarchist/reputation economies, in fact, where personal possessions have very little intrinsic value, expression and creativity are favored and so many items are artistically personalized (and actual hand\-crafted items are rare and prized).
Likewise, almost all equipment is designed with ergonomics and ease\-of\-use prioritized, so gear with soft curves, pleasing colors, and form\-fitting shapes are common.
Many items of personal technology, such as flashlights or small tools, are made in the form of ovoids that fit comfortably in the user's hand or in similar forms that can be easily worn or attached to clothing.
To someone from the 20th century, many common devices look like oddly colored rocks or decorative pieces of plastic or ceramic (in fact, many such items are referred to as \[lq]blobjects\[rq] by older transhumans).

The materials used to create everyday items are also advanced, ranging from aerogel and graphene to smart materials (p. 298) and exotic metamaterials with unusual physical properties.
In practice, this means that most items are light, durable (with both tensile strength and/or flexibility, as needed), waterproof, dirt\-repellent, and self\-cleaning.
Most gear is also designed with zero\-G or microgravity functionality in mind, and can easily be clipped, tethered, or stuck to a surface with grip pads.

Almost all gear available in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] is also available in forms that are wearable/usable by uplifted animals and non\-humanoid morphs, such as novacrabs, slitheroids, and so on.
Even if such customized gear is not immediately available, it is usually not difficult to nanofabricate.
Smart materials (p. 298) also make interoperability between different morphs easy.

\fBInterface\fR

.RS 1
It is not uncommon for everyday devices to have no visible controls as they are designed to be operated via radio broadcasts from the user's ecto or mesh inserts.
Any items crafted for use in emergency, combat, survival, or exploration situations, however, will feature basic physical controls, just in case.
Physical interfaces are typically controlled by touch pads that are nothing more than colored spots on the device's surface, though some may also project a holographic interface display.
Most equipment of this sort can can also be voice\-activated and controlled.

Almost all devices are loaded with a complete set of help files and tutorials.
Most electronics are also mesh\-capable and equipped with specialized AIs (see \f[I]Meshed Gear\f[], next page).

.RE
\fBSmart materials\fR

.RS 1
Many common items of technology are made from so\-called smart materials.
These devices contain \[em] or sometimes consist entirely of \[em] many small nanomachines that can both move and reshape themselves to alter the object's shape, color, and texture.
For example, smart clothing can transform from a suit of specialized cold weather clothing suitable for the Martian poles in winter to a fashionable suit in the latest style due to hundreds of thousands of tiny nanomachines in the clothing that shift and move to reshape the
garment.
Similarly, a tool made of smart materials can switch from a powered screwdriver to a wrench or a hammer, as the nanomachines move around and completely reshape the tool.
Smart materials all contain specialized advanced nanomachine generators (p. 328) that keep them in perfect repair as long as they are regularly recharged.

.RE
\fBFuture materials\fR

.RS 1
Many materials are available and commonly used in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] that are rare, theorized, or unheardof today.
The following entries note some of the more interesting.

.HP 1
\fBAerogel\fR
Low\-density, solid\-state \[lq]Frozen smoke\[rq] is made by carefully foaming various materials, typically glasses or ceramics, to an ultra\-low density state.
Aerogel is semi\-transparent and light\-weight, feels like styrofoam, but acts as an incredible insulator against heat and cold.
It is commonly used in habitats.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\fBDiamond\fR
Artificial diamond is lightweight and super\-strong, has an extremely high melting point, and has nearperfect thermal conductivity.
This makes it an ideal substance for hardening coated surfaces (armor) and creating super\-tough diamond machinery.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\fBFullerenes/Fullerites\fR
Fullerenes are molecular carbon structures (known as buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, and graphene) that are extremely strong (vastly stronger by weight than steel), heat\-resistant, and can be either insulative or superconductive.
This makes them useful in equipment as diverse as armor, electronics, sensor systems, or the cables of space elevators.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\fBMetallic foam\fR
Metal foam is created by adding foaming agents to liquid metals, resulting in extremely lightweight metallic structures \[em] light enough to float on water.
Ideal for habitat construction and floating cities.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\fBMetallic glass\fR
Metallic glass are metals highly alloyed to possess a disordered (rather than crystalline) atomic structure with unique combinations of stiffness and strength, making it a good wear surface and alternative to ceramics in armor.
It is also useful for its unusual (for a metal) electrical resistance properties.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\fBMetamaterials\fR
Metamaterials have unusual physical properties (usually electromagnetic) due to their structure, such as having a negative refractive index.
Metamaterials are used to create invisibility cloaks (p. 316), superlenses, phased array optics, and impressive 2\-D holograms.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\fBRefactory metals\fR
These metallic alloys have extremely high melting points, making them ideal for extremely hot engine systems, atmospheric entry vehicles, and hypersonic craft.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\fBTransparent alumina\fR
In transparent form, this ceramic is often known as sapphire.
Transparent alumina is harder than steel and zero\-g casting techniques allow for intriguing transparent construction designs, so long as its poor tensile strength is respected.
.RE


.SH Meshed gear

Almost all technology in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] is designed to be operated via radio signals from the user's basic implant, although models usable by characters without basic implants are also available.
In addition all devices contain a nearly microscopic computer and radio link (known as a \[lq]voice\[rq]) that allows the user to easily locate the object and that reports on the condition of the object or device,
how to properly use and care for it, as well as telling the user when it needs to be repaired and how.
Most are discrete and highly useful, but cheaply made goods sometimes have overly annoying voices.

This means that almost all devices can be accessed via the mesh or directly if within radio range.
This makes them vulnerable to hacking and intrusion attempts (p. 254) as well as radio jamming (p. 262).
Many devices are, however, publicly accessible (see \f[I]Spimes\f[], p. 238).
Meshed gear may also be tracked through the mesh (p. 251).
For privacy and security, these devices are often slaved to other systems (see \f[I]Slaving Devices\f[], p. 248); devices worn/carried by characters are usually made part of the personal area network and slaved to the character's mesh inserts/ ecto.
For more info on meshed devices, see the \f[I]Mesh chapter\f[], p. 234.

Many devices come equipped with AIs, who are equipped with skillsofts that enable them to operate the device on their own, as according to voiced instructions or commands issued through the net.
AIs are described on p. 264 and p. 331.

.SS Radio and sensor ranges

In \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[], almost all devices are equipped with small radios so that they may be meshed.
Likewise, many pieces of gear are equipped with sensors such as cameras, microphones, or other detectors.
The Radio and Sensor Ranges table notes what range these devices operate at.

.SS Power

All of the powered devices in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] require electricity to function.
With rare exceptions, most of them rely on either solar cells or powerful batteries.
These batteries are high\-density, room\-temperature superconductors with 25 times the capacity of the best batteries in common use in the early 21st century.
Such batteries may also be constructed so that they are flexible, printed on devices, or woven into fabric.
They are good for 100\-500 hours of use, and will alert the user when they start running low.

More powerful radio\-isotope nuclear batteries are also available, heavily shielded so they do not emit radiation and good for 3 years or more of use.
Nuclear and standard batteries are often included together, with the former recharging the latter.

In short, power should rarely be an issue in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] games, unless it happens to fit the plot.
Power failure could also result from a critical failure roll.

.SH Personal augmentation

Almost all citizens of the solar system, whether human, AI, or uplifted animal, use various forms of biological, cybernetic, or nanotechnological augmentation.
The following is a list of the most common types.

Unless otherwise noted, any bonuses from personal augmentations are both compatible and cumulative with bonuses from other enhancements.

.SS Standard augmentations

Most morphs produced in the solar system include the following augmentations.

\fBBasic biomods\fR

.RS 1
Almost universal in biomorphs, many habitats will not allow individuals to visit/immigrate if their biomorph does not possess these biomods in order to preserve public health.
Basic biomods consists of a series of genetic tweaks, tailored virii, and bacteria that speed healing, greatly increase disease resistance,
and impede aging.
A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging.
In addition, the morph requires no more than 3\-4 hours of sleep per night, is immune to ill\-effects from longterm exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not naturally suffer from biological problems like depression, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies.

\fBBasic mesh inserts\fR

.RS 1
Mesh inserts are ubiquitous among modern morphs.
This network of cybernetic brain implants is essential equipment for anyone who wants to stay connected and make full use of the wireless mesh.
The interconnected components of this system include:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Cranial computer:\f[] This computer serves as the hub for the character's personal area network and is home to their muse (p. 264).
It has all of the functions of a smartphone and PDA, acting as a media player, meshbrowser, alarm clock/calendar, positioning and map system, address book, advanced calculator, file storage system, search engine,
social networking client, messaging program, and note pad.
It manages the user's augmented reality input and can run any software the character desires (see \f[I]Software\f[], p. 331).
It also processes XP data, allowing the user to experience other people's recorded memories, and also allowing the user to share their own XP sensory input with others in real\-time.
Facial/image recognition and encryption software (p. 331) are included by default.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Radio tranciever:\f[] This transceiver connects the user to the mesh and other characters/devices within range.
It has an effective range of 20 kilometers in deep space or other locations far from radio interference and 1 kilometer in crowded habitats.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Medical sensors:\f[] This array of implants monitors the user's medical status, including heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, temperature, neural activity, and much more.

.RE
\fBCortical stack\fR

.RS 1
A cortical stack is a tiny cyberware data storage unit protected within a synthdiamond case the size of a grape, implanted at the base of the skull where the brain stem and spinal cord connect.
It contains a digital backup of that character's ego.
Part nanoware, the implant maintains a network of nanobots that monitor synaptic connections and brain architecture, noting any changes and updating the ego backup in real time, right up to the moment of death.
If the character dies, the cortical stack can be recovered and they may be restored from the backup (see Resleeving, p. 271).
Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless access (for security), they must be surgically removed (see Retrieving a Cortical Stack, p. 268).
Cortical stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort to damage or destroy.
They are commonly recovered from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or mangled.
Cortical stacks are intentionally isolated from mesh inserts and other implants, as a security measure to prevent hacking or external tampering.

.RE
\fBCyberbrain\fR

.RS 1
Cybernetic brains are where the ego (or controlling AI) resides in synthmorphs and pods.
Modeled on biological brains, cyberbrains have a holistic architecture and serve as the command node and central processing point for sensory input and decision\-making.
Only one ego or AI may \[lq]inhabit\[rq] a cyberbrain at a time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts (p. 300) or a ghostrider module (p. 307) must be used.
Since cyberbrains store memories digitally, they have the equivalent of mnemonic augmentation (p. 307).
They also have a built\-in puppet sock (p. 307) may be remote\-controlled, though this option may be removed by those who value their security.
Cyberbrains are vulnerable to brainhacking (p. 261) and other forms of electronic infiltration/attack.
Cyberbrains come equipped with two or more pairs of external access jacks (p. 306), usually located at the base of the skull, which allow for direct wired connections.

.RE
.SS Bioware

Bioware augmentations can be acquired either as a genemod when the morph is designed and grown or as a later modification to an existing morph, either by using nanomachines to modify the morph's tissue or by externally growing the organ and implanting it.
Bioware may be used to enhance biomorphs (including pods and uplifts), but not synthmorphs.
Bioware may be used to enhance biomorphs (including pods and uplifts), but not synthmorphs (see Synthmorphs and Bioware, p. 306).

\fBEnhanced senses\fR

The following are a list of the most common enhanced senses.
Each is also available as a cybernetic implant, but bioware is much more common.

.HP 1
\f[B]Direction Sense:\f[] The character has an innate sense of direction and distance using advanced inertial navigation.
The character can arbitrarily define any point as \[lq]north\[rq] and keep track of which direction that is, as well as knowing approximately how far they have come.
Characters with this augmentation can always retrace any route they have taken, only experiencing difficulty with three\-dimensional routes lacking navigational markers (such as deep space or undersea; apply a \-30 modifier).
Since positioning inside habitats by anyone with basic mesh inserts is an automatic affair, only characters venturing to remote locations require this augmentation.

This multiplicity is not viewed as a disorder, but as a cognitive tool to help people deal with their hypercomplex environments.
This extra personality can be an NPC run by the gamemaster, a separate character (in ego form only) made by the player, or the downloaded fork of another character.
For all intents and purposes, the extra personality is treated as a separate ego (i.e., it may fork separately), except that both personalities are backed up in the same cortical stack and if downloaded they must be placed in separate morphs or in another morph with this

Only one ego may be in control of the morph at a time.
The other resides in the background, still active, but not on a surface level.
Each ego is completely aware of what the other is doing, thinking, etc.
If for some reason the subsumed personality wants to come to the fore, but the other personality won't relinquish control, make an Opposed \fIWIL × 3\fR Test.
Each ego has its own Lucidity and Trauma Threshold, and they track stress and trauma separately.

.SS Using enhanced senses

Personal augmentations and technological aids have drastically increased the sensory capabilities of most transhumans.
The following notes provide some details on what capabilities these sensory functions provide.
The capabilities are typically the same whether it's a biological sense or a technological sensor, though tech sensors can \[lq]turn off\[rq] certain wavelengths and sense only specific frequencies, whereas biological senses perceive the full spectrum with no ability to filter
parts out.

\fBSensory databases\fR

.RS 1
Both technological sensors and enhanced biological senses come equipped with databases of scanned \[lq]signatures\[rq] that make it easier to identify whatever the user is sensing (in the case of bioware, these databases are stored and accessed via the character's mesh inserts).
For example, infrared sensors feature databases listing the heat signatures of different animals and items, making it easier to identify such things.
In relevant situations, apply a +20 modifier for identifying targets sensed this way.

An active scanner must actually emit its particular frequency and then measure the reflections; this means a similar sensor can detect it and home in on the emitting source.
For example, a character with enhanced vision can literally see the terahertz radiation emitted by someone using an active terahertz sensor, much like someone with normal vision can see the light emitted by a flashlight.

Similar to radar, terahertz sensors can see through walls and other materials, but to a lesser extent (up to a cumulative Armor + Durability of 50).
T\-rays occur naturally, but terahertz sensors normally require an emitter as they are absorbed by atmosphere (as well as water and metal).

Mid\-long infrared is excellent for detecting heat sources (unobstructed by fog or smoke) and temperature differences (as small as 0.1 degree C), and such thermal imaging will sense the dissipating heat traces left by warm sources on colder ones, allowing the user to see where someone was
sitting, trace fading heat footprints, or see what buttons were pressed if they are quick enough.
Infrared also detects the blood flow in a biomorph's face, which can be useful in judging emotional states (+20 modifier to Kinesics Tests), and can spot subsurface implants.
Some normally white surfaces are reflective (mirrored) in infrared, potentially allowing an infrared viewer to see around corners or behind themselves.

This broadcaster contains approximately 10 nanograms of antimatter stored in an orange\-sized triply\-redundant magnetic containment vessel.
If the character is dying or urgently wishes to depart the morph, this tiny amount of antimatter is brought into contact with a similarly tiny amount of matter in a controlled fashion that generates a single brief and carefully coded neutrino pulse of the ego's most recent backup.
However, the heat generated by this process literally cooks the entire morph, killing it and destroying all implants and electronics in or on it.

This entire process takes less than 0.1 second and the broadcast can be received as long as the neutrino receiver is within 100 astronomical units of the character.
Within the solar system, this implant effectively guarantees the character's backup.
It is less useful on exoplanets where the character is out of neutrino range of their backup facility.
The amount of antimatter carried by this implant is sufficiently small enough that it does not produce an explosion and will not damage any surrounding objects.
Most habitats carefully scan all visitors to determine if they have this implant and if the amounts of antimatter involved are sufficiently low as not to pose a danger to the habitat and its inhabitants, and some ban this implant entirely.

\f[B]Mnemonic Augmentation:\f[] A character with this augmentation and a cortical stack can access digital recordings of all of the sensory data they have experienced in XP format (and they may share these recordings with others).
Mnemonic augmentation differs from the eidetic memory bioware because it allows characters to digitally share all of their sensory data with others.
It also allows them to closely examine sensory data they did not initially look at.
For example, If the character glanced at a note but did not read it, they can later use image enhancement software to enhance this image and in most cases actually read what the note said.
Mnemonic augmentation allows the character to clearly hear all background noises, like a conversation at a nearby table that the character only initially heard a few words of.
Using mnemonic augmentation to retrieve a specific piece of information is quite easy, but usually requires between 2 and 20 minutes of concentration.

\f[B]Multi\-Tasking:\f[] Only characters with cortical stacks can possess this augmentation.
The character has an advanced computer installed in their brain that uses the data in the cortical stack to create several simultaneous short\-term forks to handle various mental tasks.
By design, this computer automatically reintegrates all of these forks into the character's core personality after a maximum of 4 hours, earlier if desired.
This augmentation allows the character to both plan a speech and engage in intensive mesh\-browsing while simultaneously fighting a gun battle or running from pursuit, since each of the forks operates independently.
However, these forks can only perform purely mental or on\-line interactions.
This augmentation can produce a maximum of two forks at a time, giving the character an extra two Complex Actions on every Action Phase for mental or on\-line actions.
This implant cannot be used simultaneously with any other augmentation that allows for extra actions, or with the mental speed augmentation (p. 308).

Implanted sensors automatically cause the character to use the stored oxygen if they detect poisonous or insufficient atmosphere.

Medichines eliminate most diseases, drugs, and toxins (but not nanodrugs or nanotoxins) before they can do more than minor harm to the host (see Drug Effects, p. 318).
If desired, the user can temporarily override this protection to permit intoxication or other effects, but unless the character activates a second specially labeled override, medichines prevent the toxins from accumulating to lethal or permanently harmful levels.
In this case, they can also be activated at a later point to reduce a drug or toxin's remaining duration by half.

Medichines allow the character to ignore the effects of 1 wound.
They also speed normal healing as noted under Biomorph Healing, p. 208.
If the user suffers 5 or more wounds at once, or more than 6 wounds in an hour, the damage has exceeded the medichines' ability to repair.
In this case, the medichines place the character into a medical stasis, where their mind and body are perfectly preserved, but where the character cannot act in any way.
Under these circumstances the medichines also send out a priority call for emergency services via the character's mesh inserts.
Medichines for synthmorphs and bots consist of nanobots that monitor and repair the shell's integrity and internal system functions.

Time seems to subjectively slow down for the character, allowing them to carefully plan their next action, even if they only have a split second to do so.
With this system active, the character can discern things occurring too fast for a normal human to perceive, such as the individual frames of an old analog film or understanding sounds that were accelerated to many times their normal speed.
The character can also read 10 times faster than normal and can track the paths of bullets and similar fast\-moving objects with a successful Perception Test.

Modern personal armor systems have advanced from the high modulus polyethylene thermoplastics and aramid fabrics of the early 21st century.

Occasionally other materials are used, such as metallic glass plates or shear\-resistant fluids that harden against impacts.
Such armor protects against (armor\-piercing) bullets and kinetic impacts as well as bladed weapons and piercing sharp objects.
They also insulate against both the explosive heating of energy weapons and electrical shocks.
While such armor protects against bullets, the layers of material catch the bullet and redistribute its kinetic energy across the body, which can still result in severe blunt force trauma.

.SS Neutrino communicators

Neutrinos are particles that can pass through any solid matter with ease and are impossible to block.
As a result, they make an ideal medium for communications.
Unfortunately, they are also easy to intercept.
Even a tight beam of neutrinos sent between two locations can be intercepted simply by placing another receiver behind the location the broadcaster is sending to.
Neutrino communicators require a large power plant to power the high energy particle interactions required to generate the neutrino broadcast.
Neutrino receivers are also relatively large, with the smallest occupying 100 cubic meters.
In most cases, neutrino communicators are designed to broadcast neutrinos in all directions, though tight\-beam transmissions are also possible.

.SS Quantum farcasters

Quantum farcasters are special computers designed to protect a communications channel (such as fiberoptic, radio, laser/microwave, or neutrino) with unbreakable encryption.
To function, two or more quantum farcaster computers must first be entangled together (on a quantum level) in the same physical location.
The farcasters may then be separated, at which point they may continue to exchange encrypted data via quantum teleportation.
This data exchange requires a standard communications link (fiberoptic, radio, laser/microwave, or neutrino), and so is limited by the speed of light, but it is a high bandwidth form of communications.
The quantum encryption used by these entangled farcasters is unbreakable, and any attempted interception is immediately detected and neutralized.
A quantum farcaster may not be used to securely communicate with any farcasters other than the ones it is entangled with.

Because it is exceptionally safe and secure, quantum farcasting via neutrino communications is the primary means of both long\-distance communication between habitats and egocasting (p. 276).
The neutrino signal cannot be blocked and it can only be decrypted if a character has access to the computer that is sending or receiving the signal.

.SS Quantum entanglement communication

The rarest form of communications is quantum entangled (QE) communication.
QE communication is instantaneous and works over any distance, but is also very limited.
QE communication requires pairs of entangled particles known as qubits.
To use QE, large number of pairs of qubits are created and then separated from each other.
Millions of these separated pairs of particles are stored in special containers known as qubit reservoirs.
If two QE communicators each have a qubit reservoir containing qubits that are each entangled with qubits in the other communicator's qubit reservoir, then characters can use the two QE communicators to commutate with one another instantaneously.
Characters can use QE to instantly communicate between any two locations, even if one character is in the solar system and the other has passed through a Pandora gate and is standing on a planet 500 light years away.

Each bit of data transmitted between these two QE comms uses up one qubit.
Once all of the qubits are used up, the two QE comms can no longer communicate with each other until they each get a new batch of entangled qubits.
Qubits are expensive to produce, contain, and transport, making this an exceedingly expensive form of communication.
As a result, extremely high bandwidth communications like full sensory AR and egocasting cannot be performed using QE communication.

\f[B]Portable QE Comm:\f[] This is a handheld FTL communications device.
The actual communications unit can be made as small as desired, but must be large enough to connect to or hold a qubit reservoir.

The smart dust can then either broadcast a brief, highly compressed signal, or it can send all of its information to a few hundred nanobots that then walk to a pre\-arranged destination for pickup and downloading by their user.
The user need only find a single nanobot with a nanodetector to acquire the information obtained by the smart dust.
If ordered to do so, the remaining nanobots can either power down and await further orders or self\-destruct in a fashion that turns them into a tiny amount of dust made mostly of metal and silicon.

\f[B]Traction Pads:\f[] This set of specialized fingerless gloves, shoes, and kneepads is designed to emulate the pads on geckos' feet.
Characters can support themselves on a wall or ceiling by placing any two of these pads against any surface not made from a material specially designed to resist such devices.
Characters can climb any surface and move easily across walls and ceilings that can support their weight (+30 to Climbing Tests).
In addition to climbing, these devices are also very popular in zero\-g environments.

.SS Bugs and surveilance

Though surveillance technologies are pervasive and easy to come by in Eclipse Phase, secretly obtaining information on someone who wants to retain privacy can be quite difficult.
Microbugs, smart dust, and similar recording devices that are all but invisible may be exceptionally easy to put into place, but once they begin actively transmitting, they are easy to to detect (see Wireless Scanning, p. 251).
An eavesdropper may attempt to stealth the signal (see Stealthed Signals, p. 252), but this is not guaranteed to work.
Once a signal is detected, locating the broadcasting device is usually just a matter of time (see \f[I]Tracking\f[], p. 251).

Some recording devices attempt to avoid this problem by using miniature quantum farcasters (p. 314), but those are far larger and more difficult to hide.
Often the most effective way to acquire discrete information is to plant a surveillance device, set to record but not transmit, and then retrieve it later.
While doing this is often difficult and risky, the recording device never reveals its presence by broadcasting and so is more difficult to detect.

.SH Drugs, chemicals and toxins

In \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[], the transhuman desire to enhance the body and mind \[em] especially with chemicals \[em] merges right into humanity's popular pastime of recreational substance abuse.
Drugs of all kinds, whether they be chemical, nano\-based, or electronic, are not only popular but widespread.
While advances in biotechnology have eliminated many of the side effects that once plagued drug users, transhuman bodies remain complicated environments, and so side effects (especially with long\-term use) are still a factor.
Additionally, addiction is always a consideration for anyone who gets comfortable with popping the same pills too often, though there are also drugs for addiction of course.

Drug descriptions include benefits, side effects, noticeable signs that a person is using the drug, addictiveness, and effects from long\-term use).
Descriptions also include the drug's Duration and its Addiction Modifier (see \f[I]Addiction and Substance Abuse\f[]).

.SS Substance rules

These rules explain how to handle drugs and toxins.

\fBClassification of substances\fR

.RS 1
Substances fall into four categories:

.HP 1
\f[B]Chemicals:\f[] These are pharmacologically\-active small chemical compounds (toxins, pharmaceuticals, chemical drugs) that have been produced by chemical synthesis, nanotech fabrication, or enzymatic biosynthesis in (transgenic) organisms.
They include naturally\- occurring drugs from known species of (exo\-)flora and fauna, endotoxins produced by biological organisms, enhancements of endogenic substances (designer drugs), and de novo developments designed for a specific medical or recreational
application.
Chemical drugs affect only biological morphs and pods.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Biologicals:\f[] These include peptides, hormones, and biologically\-based substances like biotoxins, bacteria, and viral organisms \[em] drugs devised or based on naturally\-occurring endogenic biological substances.
This category also includes infectious biological organisms that can produce drug\-like effects, like virii and bacteria.
Biologicals affect biomorphs and pods but not synthetic morphs or infomorphs.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Nanodrugs:\f[] These are temporary nanobot colonies programmed to create a certain effect.
While nanobots are generally able to target or infect all morph types except infomorphs, exactly which morphs are affected usually depends on the pre\-programmed effect (i.e., whether it targets a biological or mechanical mechanism).
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Electronic:\f[] Electronic drugs include software and technology that affect the brain directly, such as manipulative XP programs or retro\-tech like transcranial magnetic stimulation or cranial electrotherapy.
It also includes narcoalgorithms \[em] programs that reproduce drug\-like effects for AIs, infomorphs, and egos residing in cyberbrains.
.RE

\fBApplication methods\fR

.RS 1
There are a number of vectors by which a substance may be applied to a morph.

.HP 1
\f[B]Dermal (D):\f[] This drug or toxin is absorbed via the skin (or exterior hull with some nanotoxins) as either a gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., paste).
Slap patches and slap bands are commonly used, loaded with the chemical DMSO, which transfers the drug through the skin.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Inhalation (INH):\f[] This is a gas that is breathed into the lungs or snorted nasally.
Used for inhalers, aerosols, powders, and gas grenades/seekers.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Injected (INJ):\f[] This liquid is applied via either an intramuscular or intravenous injection.
Used for needles and piercing weapons.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Oral (O):\f[] This is a liquid or solid that is absorbed through the stomach or oral cavity (eating or drinking).
Used with pills and liquids.
.RE

\fBDrug effects\fR

.RS 1
If a character is exposed to a drug via its method of application \[em] for example, they pop a pill, slap on a dermal patch, are soaked with a splash grenade, breathe in gas, or get stabbed with a coated weapon
\[em] then they are subject to the drug's effects.
The onset time determines how long these effects take to kick in, and the duration determines how long they last.

While there is no resistance test to ignore a drug or toxin's effects once exposed, in some cases (especially toxins) a test might be called for to determine the \f[I]severity\f[] of the effects.

Unless otherwise noted or specifically overridden, medichines (p. 308) will protect a character from drug/toxin effects (but not nanodrugs/nanotoxins).
Enhancements like toxin filters (p. 305) may also impede a drug's effect or provide complete resistance.
If an antidote is taken in advance or before the effects kick in, the drug will not work.

\fBAddiction and substance abuse\fR

.RS 1
Some drugs are addictive, either physically (affecting the morph) or mentally (affecting the ego) \[em] and sometimes both.
Every time a character uses the drug (or after an appropriate amount of use, as determined by the gamemaster), they must make a \fIWIL × 3\fR Test to avoid addiction.
Each drug has an Addiction Modifier that will modify this test.

Failure indicates that the character has become addicted \[em] they immediately acquire the Addiction negative trait (p. 148).
Addiction is measured in three levels: Minor, Moderate, and Major.
The severity determines how often an addicted character needs the drug and what the negative effects of not using the drug are.

An addicted character must continue to make \fIWIL × 3\fR Tests as they use the drug, as determined by the gamemaster.
Failure indicates the character's addiction severity increases.

The negative effects from not using a drug end whenever the character does the drug again.
Durability and Lucidity penalties are not damage, but temporary decreases to the character's maximum values; the character immediately regains the lost Durability or Lucidity when they do the drug again.

Addiction is of indefinite duration.
To clean up, the character must stay off the drug for 1 week for each level of addiction.
Resisting this craving is difficult, and should at least require another \fIWIL × 3\fR Test, modified by the drug's Addiction modifier.
Players and gamemasters are encouraged to roleplay an attempt to kick a habit.
Each week the character is off the drug, the addiction drops by one level.
When it reaches 0, the character is clean ...
though there is always danger of a relapse.

Physical addictions do not carry over to a new morph if the character resleeves, but mental addictions do.
If the character uploads and resleeves, the mental addictions persist, and the morph the character leaves behind remains physically addicted.
This means that poor or unlucky characters may occasionally find themselves resleeved into a morph that has a physical addiction.
In this case, the character is subject to the physical addictiveness of the drug but not the mental addiction, although if they break down and indulge in the drug, they may themself become physically addicted.

Characters who resleeve as infomorphs can remain mentally addicted to a substance despite no longer having a body.
The market is always happy to provide, though; a wide variety of narcoalgorithms mirroring the effects of most of the drugs described below are available for infomorphs and AIs.
For the infomorphported narcoalgorithm version of any physicallyonly addictive drug described below, consider the Addictiveness to be effectively physical.
The character remains addicted as long as they are an infomorph, but they do not remain addicted if they sleeve into a physical morph.

.SS Drugs

The drugs described here are usually (but not always beneficial), and are typically taken intentionally.
Drugs and chemicals used offensively are described under Chemicals and Toxins, both on p. 323.
Note that the drugs here are just a representative sampling.
There are thousands if not millions of drugs in circulation in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[] \[em] gamemasters are encouraged to introduce their own, using these as guidelines.

\fBCognitive drugs\fR

\f[B]Neem:\f[] Neem is a mnemonic drug that works by \[lq]tagging\[rq] experiences and mental input with a set of unique sensations that contribute to the formation of state\-based memories.
Neem gummy chews come in a variety of fruit flavors shaped like extinct old Earth animals.
Neem gives characters a +20 bonus on COG Tests to recall information they learned while on Neem (see \f[I]Memorizing and Remembering\f[], p. 176).
The drawback to Neem is that memories they accumulate while under the drug's influence have no emotional association.
For example, a character who witnessed something horrible happening to a friend or who had a fight with a romantic partner while on Neem would feel no emotional connection whatsoever to what happened.

Combat drugs are an easy way of evening the odds in a fight.

.HP 1
\f[B]BringIt:\f[] In some respects more a social than a combat drug, BringIt stimulates massive bursts of aggression pheromones designed to make the user the center of attention in a fight.
In combat, opponents within 3 meters of the character not already in unarmed or melee combat with another character must pass a \fIWIL × 3\fR Test or attack the character using BringIt.
The nature of airborne pheromones is imprecise, however, so if the character using BringIt is within 1 meter of another character hostile to the character affected, the affected character may opt to attack the proximate character instead of the BringIt user.
Characters using this drug suffer a \-20 modifier on social skill tests.

\f[B]Kick:\f[] Kick is a strong stimulant that increases the user's response time and puts them on edge.
The character gains +10 REF and +1 Speed for the duration of the drug.
Characters under the influence of Kick are twitchy, however, reacting in a jumpy, cat\-like fashion to sudden or unexpected stimuli.
At the gamemaster's discretion, they must make a \fIWIL × 2\fR Test or react without thinking towards unexpected noises or other surprises.
Long\-term users suffer \fI\-5 COO\fR.

\f[B]MRDR:\f[] MRDR is a straightforward and brutal combat drug.
It increases pain tolerance, speed, and strength.
The character receives +10 SOM, +1 Speed, +10 Durability, and may ignore the \-10 modifier of one wound.
Any damage incurred while under the effects of the drug is taken from the bonus Durability first.
MRDR users are easily identifiable by the broken blood vessels in their eyes, tense posture, and visible tension in the muscles of the face, arms, and legs.
Long\-term users suffer \fI\-5 SOM\fR.

\f[B]Phlo:\f[] Phlo increases alertness and coordination, making the user more graceful and nimble in a fray.
The character gains +5 COO and +10 on Perception Tests for the duration of the drug.
Everything feels possible to a character on Phlo, and so they are vulnerable to being goaded into actions that might be foolish or dangerous (apply a \-10 modifier to appropriate Social Skill Tests).

Mono No Aware gives the character a +10 bonus on Art and Sense Tests.
With frequent use, Mono No Aware reacts with pigments in the skin to create a pallor with a slight bluish tinge, even in darker\-skinned morphs.

\f[B]Orbital Hash:\f[] Good ol' reefer \[em] but grown in space using powerful lighting and post\-singularity hydroponics.
Because space is at a premium in habitats and scum barges, blocks of hashish are the preferred mode of transport and delivery.
However, for the wealthy and on planets, buds in leaf form are not uncommon.
Hash allows the character to ignore the effects of 1 trauma, but inflicts a \-10 penalty on all memory\-related tests and Knowledge Skill Tests.
Hash users exhibit bloodshot eyes, lethargic behaviors, and the munchies.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
.RE

.SS Social drugs

.RS 1
These social lubricants affect the user's interactions with others.

.HP 1
\f[B]Alpha:\f[] Alpha is a more subtle version of BringIt, popular with hypercorp execs, street thugs, and anyone else who wants to come across as a domineering asshole.
The pharm designer who invented it had a retro sensibility (and maybe a sick sense of humor); Alpha is typically synthesized as a sparkling white powder designed to be snorted.
Alpha stimulates production of threat pheromones, but less bluntly than BringIt.
Alpha imparts confidence, a feeling of power, and alertness.
Users can function without sleep for 4 days, after which point they need to catch up with at least 4 hours of sleep (remember morphs with basic biomods require less sleep).
Dosed characters receive a +20 modifier on Intimidation Tests and +10 on Persuasion and Networking Tests where attitude is a factor (gamemaster discretion).
These bonuses only apply to characters within 2 meters of the Alpha user.

On the downside, alpha users are impatient, unfocused assholes.
At the gamemaster's discretion, Social skill modifiers may be reversed to penalties with certain types of people.
Additionally, Alpha users suffer \-10 on all COG skill tests related to memory and coherent or logical thinking.
Long\-term users may suffer the COG penalty even when not on the drug; on it, they may be worse.

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Hither:\f[] Want to ooze sexy like a pleasure morph on a hot tin roof?
For those desiring that slinky je\-nesais\- quoi, Hither is the tool.
Hither is a clear, slippery gel, sometimes with a faint, musky, floral scent.
Hither is applied to parts of the body with large concentrations of sweat glands, where the skin quickly absorbs it.
Hither is a mild euphoriant, imparting a feeling of confidence and you\-know\-you\-want\-it\-ness to the user.
It also stimulates abundant production of lust pheromones.
The character gains a +10 bonus on Persuasion Tests against targets who are possible to seduce.
At the gamemaster's discretion, this extends to Deception, Impersonate, and Networking Tests.
\f[B][Low]\f[]

\f[B]Juice:\f[] This potent anti\-depressant makes it almost impossible to have bad feelings or negative thoughts.
The character is unnaturally happy \[em] often irritatingly or strangely so.

.SS Nanodrugs

Nanodrugs are temporary nanobot infestations that apply a specific effect.

.HP 1
\f[B]Frequency:\f[] Frequency (or Freeq) is a nanodrug designed as a tool for scientific visualization.
It releases a small swarm of nanobots into the character's bloodstream that settle in the epidermis, where they act as sensors of electromagnetic radiation.
This sensory input is then injected into the character's visual and tactile sensoria, hitting the user with a sequence of novel stimuli, typically a light show or weird tactile sensations.
Aside from its recreational uses, Frequency is good at picking up on localized field radiation with a standard Perception Test.
A character can take advantage of this to spot sensors and hidden electronics.
Similar to now\-obsolete 20th\-century hallucinogens like LSD and psilocybin, however, a Frequency trip can be disorienting and upsetting (the gamemaster should apply any modifiers, mental stress, or even trauma as they feel appropriate).
Characters typically experience a period about 1/3 of the way through their trip in which sensory input is extremely intense; during this period, which usually lasts about 2 hours, they are unable to read.

\f[B]Gravy:\f[] Gravy assists characters in acclimating to high gravity environments.
It comes in a variety of flavors and is often added as a sauce to food.
For Gravy to be 100% effective, the character must begin using it in advance.
Reduce penalties for high\-gravity acclimation by 20.

.RE

.HP 1
\f[B]Schizo:\f[] Schizo is a nanodrug that mirrors the effects of paranoid schizophrenia.
It is popular in some hyperelite social circles as a truly daring and intriguing experience.
A dose of schizo looks like a disposable antique razor blade.
Making an incision in the skin releases a swarm of nanobots that travel to the central nervous system and induce the effects of the drug.
While in effect, the character is severely paranoid and hears voices.
How this plays out is at the discretion of the gamemaster, but should include irrational fears, unusual compulsions based on the instructions of the voice or voices, and a strong possibility that the character will behave in a violent or destructive fashion.
The character may make \fIWIL × 3\fR Tests to avoid violent acts against objects or strangers.
Friends and trusted acquaintances are probably less likely to be targets of violence (+30 modifier to avoid hurting people the character cares about or destroying important possessions).
Note that the character's muse is unaffected by Schizo and can make efforts to babysit the character.
Characters who take Schizo suffer 1d10 mental stress.

\fBPetals\fR

.RS 1
Petals is a term for a type of narrative hallucinogen, a nanodrug that hijacks the senses and takes the user on a game\-like, highly immersive trip.
Known by a myriad of intriguing names \[em] Forgotten Hand, Darkly Selving, Inquisitive Green, to name a few \[em] Petals are post\-Fall society's heroin \[em] the drug of choice for the desperate and fucked.
Petals almost always appear as nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem.
Plucking and swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects immediately.
Flowers have 5\[en]10 petals.
Multiple users may share the experience if they take the Petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent white and become inert.

Petal experiences are like entire scenarios in and of themselves.
Some take place entirely in the user's mesh inserts (the user must cede control of their implants voluntarily; if they do not, the drug has no effect other than producing very low\-intensity LSD\-like visual hallucinations), taking control of the character's entoptic displays,
linking to secretive mesh servers and other trippers, and invading the character's sensorium with AR \[lq]hallucinations.\[rq] Others put the character into a near\-comatose state during which they go on a head trip.
Normally there is some kind of well\-developed theme or plot to a Petal experience, although in some cases they just experience a stream of images.

Though most societies seek to suppress Petals, new ones appear constantly, fueled by a persistent subculture of crafters and users.
Petalcrafters view their work as an art form (or at least as really good entertainment), and the better Petals are lovingly crafted, hauntingly beautiful experiences \[em] even if they're also terrifying.
The subculture of Petal use ranges from casual users who occasionally do an easy, short\-duration flower to hardcore addicts who spend much of their time not on Petals trying to hunt down the most intense and esoteric varieties.
From this subculture comes a lot of information on what various Petals look like and their effects.
Because Petals combine custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and sometimes connections to mesh servers, duplicating them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an active market of crafters,
dealers, and traders.

Petals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards, called \[lq]sweets\[rq] by petal users.
Getting the sweets usually requires fulfilling certain conditions within the trip, such as correctly answering questions or fulfilling goals.
Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing or product designs, and custom infomorph sleeves.

On the negative side, some Petal trips go bad, flooring 1d10 mental stress or more on the user.
Perhaps worse, some Petals are loaded with malware that takes over the user's mesh inserts and worse \[em] some sentinels even whisper of Petals carrying strains of the Exsurgent virus.

\f[B]Forgotten hand\f[]
One of the character's hands detaches and makes a run for it.
The character is conscious and able to interact normally with the real world, but they cannot perceive the \[lq]escaped\[rq] hand and firmly believe that it's getting away.
The hand will lead the character a merry chase, but at some point, a new hand appears on the character's wrist.
It may be glittery and opalescent, demonic and clawed, or bestial.
Eventually, after an hour or two, the character will catch up to their hand, but to get rid of their new hand and re\-attach the old, they must answer cryptic questions posed by a gnome\-like being.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Darkly selving\f[]
This petal is believed to achieve many of its effects by connecting to the mesh, where an AI observes and controls some of the event flow, and only works for multiple trippers.
Like Forgotten Hand, it works by overlaying AR perceptions on the real world, but because of the effects, it's highly inadvisable to take in places where any non\-trippers will be present.
Darkly Selving creates an epsilon fork of each character tripping and sleeves the fork in an infomorph that looks like a demonic version of themself, using visual input from the character's co\-trippers.
AR overlays cause the characters to perceive themselves as angelic beings, while the realseeming demonic infomorphs appear as AR overlays on their real world perceptions.
What happens next varies, but generally both the characters and their forks are subjected to a series of strong chemical and narcoalgorithmic stimuli, ranging from Hitherlike effects to massive doses of MRDR (or sometimes both).
The effects directed against the forks are generally much more intense.
The objective \[em] hinted at via environmental clues \[em] is to merge with one's fork, which can be accomplished in a variety of ways, ranging from hunting them down and eating their heart to solving a puzzle or reaching a goal before their forks can.
.RE

.RS 1
.HP 1
\f[B]Delphinium six\f[]
The last and rarest in a series of petals, Delphinium Six is the Grail of petal users, a supposedly transcendental experience that might not even exist.
Delphinium One is scarce, Two and Three are quite rare, Four is an amazing find, and Five and Six are only rumors.
Hints of what Six might hold are based largely on extrapolation from the little that is known about the lower\-numbered petals.
The following facts are generally accepted.
It is a group experience, but not all members of the tripping group are rewarded equally.
It is intensely surreal, yet in a purposeful way, as are all of the Delphinium series.
It concludes the loosely\-built narrative of a drugged\-out version of a fairy tale princess and her quest for enlightenment begun in Delphinium One, replete with strange omens and mythological creatures.
Rumors of what the ending might hold are more fanciful, and range from the trippers being resleeved in god\-like infomorphs to them being trapped forever in an ego prison.
Delphinium Six is completely virtual, leaving the characters comatose for the duration, and probably lasts a long time, perhaps 40 hours.
.RE

.SS Other nanodrugs

Nanodrugs have the capability of making fundamental changes to a body's biochemistry and mental state.
The potential effects are too numerous to list, but gamemasters should consider allowing nanodrugs that temporarily apply certain traits, such as Brave, Direction Sense, Math Wiz, Pain Tolerance, Psi Chameleon, Psi Defense, Situational Awareness, Tough, Feeble, Frail, Low Pain
Tolerance, Mental Disorder, Mild Allergy, Neural Damage, Psi Vulnerability, Severe Allergy, Timid, VR Conditioning, VR Vertigo, Weak Immune System, or Zero\-G Nausea.
Similarly, the nanodrug could force the character into a particular mental emotional state, such as a bad mood, edginess, contentment, or overconfidence.
Gamemasters are encouraged to experiment with different possibilities and effects.

A pathogen is an infectious biological agent that causes disease or illness to its host.
While natural pathogens rarely strive to kill their hosts, germ warfare programs revived during the Fall \[em] or instigated by the TITANs \[em] sought to modify and use pathogens as a weapon of war.
The ideal characteristics of lethal biological agents are high infectivity, high potency, availability of vaccines, and delivery as an aerosol.
Most biomorphs are immune to standard pathogens thanks to their basic bio\-mods, and medichines will protect against most others.
However, even these defenses may not protect against diseases left by the TITANs or a new terrorist cell's biowar bug.
It is largely recommended that pathogens be handled as a plot device, rather than an active threat to the characters.

.SH Nanotechnology

Nanotechnology is the precise manipulation of matter at the atomic level, typically using millions of microscale nanomachines.
Nanotechnology transformed manufacturing, enabling new techniques and materials.
The advent of nanofabrication \[em] building objects from the molecular level up \[em] transformed economies, allowing people to simply manufacture whatever they needed from raw materials.
Nanotechnology is still a growing field, however, and has its limitations.
While the TITANs unleashed self\-replicating nanoswarms with the ability to transform or destroy anything through the power of geometric growth, such technology remains far beyond transhumanity's grasp.

.SS Basic nanotechnology

Basic nanotechnology is exceedingly widespread and used throughout the solar system, serving as the primary method of manufacturing for decades.
The nanobots of basic nanotech are confined to delicate and specially\-maintained environments like the insides of cornucopia machines or healing vats and cannot operate elsewhere.

\fBHealing vats\fR

.RS 1
Healing vats were the first type of nanotech medicine developed and remain the most powerful medical devices in common use.
With the exception of a few exceptionally deadly nanoplagues, a healing vat can cure any disease and heal any injury.
As long as the patient is alive when they are place in the healing vat, they will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch.
A healing vat can even take a severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the head's genetics.
If the patient's body or medical records contain information about their implants, bioware, or advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications are also fully restored.

Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require a healing vat.
Most are used as a safe and easy way to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or bioware.
Healing vats use specialized nanomachines to either alter the patient's body or integrate implants or bioware.
One advantage of using a healing vat is that no additional healing time is needed, the patient leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation and ready to go.
Every hospital, clinic, bodyshop, and augmentation parlor has several healing vats.
The time required by a healing vat varies with the severity of the damage it is healing or the extent of the modification being made, as noted on the Healing Vat table, p. 327.

.RS 1
Nanodetectors are small devices that suck in air and micro debris in order to scan for and detect nanobots.
Given that nanobots are so small, the density of nanobots in the area has a large impact on its success.
The nanodetector has a base skill of 30 for detecting nanobots, modified by +30 if an active nanoswarm or hive is present, +0 if a nanoswarm or hive was active recently, and \-10 for the presence of nanobots outside of a swarm or hive.
Once a nanobot is detected it may be analyzed either by the user or the nanodetector's AI, using Academics: Nanotechnology 30 skill.
Nanodetectors are often worn and left on, set to alert the user if a hostile nanoswarm is detected.

\fBNanofabricators\fR

.RS 1
Nanofabrication machines are universal assemblers that perform almost all of the manufacturing in the solar system.
The user loads in raw materials and electronic plans and it can produce literally any manufactured good, from a weapon to an ultralight plane to a hot and delicious dinner.
Many nanofabricators come equipped with a library of common\-use blueprints (basic foods, standard clothing, common tools, etc.).
Other blueprints must either be purchased online, selfprogrammed, or acquired through some other method (see \f[I]Nanofabrication\f[], p. 284).
The largest nanofabrication units are more than 10 meters on a side and are used to produce small consumer goods in bulk as well as building large devices like orbital transfer vehicles.

The availability and legality of nanofabricators varies widely throughout the system.
In the inner system and Jovian Republic, cornucopia machines are commonly restricted and sometimes illegal, with licenses only available to hypercorps, military units, and other officials and elites.
In these habitats, only more limited fabbers are available to the general populace.
Additionally, blueprints are licensed and protected by copyright laws, and many nanofabricators feature pre\-programmed restrictions that prevent them from using unlicensed blueprints as well as from
manufacturing weapons, explosives, or other restricted items.
Among the autonomists of the outer system, however, nanofabricators are commonly accessible, shared by everyone, and unrestricted.

For rules on creating goods in a nanofabricator, see \f[I]Nanofabrication\f[], p. 284.

It is sometimes possible to assemble larger items, but they must be manufactured in smaller pieces and then assembled (likely requiring an appropriate Hardware Test).

While users can purchase bulk raw materials, CMs also come equipped with a disassembler.

\fBNanoswarms and microswarms\fR

.RS 1
Swarms are colonies of nanobots or larger microbots created in a hive, programmed with specific instructions, and then set free to perform a set task.
Each swarm is composed of hundreds or thousands of nanobots or microbots, ranging in size from a microbe to a small insect.
Nanobots are typically invisible to the naked eye, though they can be detected with a nanodetector (p. 326) or nanoscopic vision (p. 311).
Microbots are more noticeable but still quite small, usually the size of a grain of sand or a dust mote, or occasionally as big as a flea.
Individual bots in a swarm are directed by nanocomputers, with behavioral routines modeled on biological insect and animal swarms.
These swarms stick together and work as a whole, communicating with nanoradios, nanolasers, or chemical cues, and sharing information between each bot in the swarm.
Note that nanoswarms don't invade inside living bodies (though they may attack externally) \[em] internal nano is handled by nanoware (p. 308), nanodrugs (p. 321), and nanotoxins (p. 324).

Nanobots and microbots may be designed with all manner of miniaturized propulsion systems (see \f[I]Mobility Systems\f[], p. 310), with the exception of ionic drives.
They are powered by tiny batteries or solar cells.
Their tiny sensors are very effective at allowing them to identify materials and objects, and so to target discriminatingly.
Nanobots or microbots could, for example, be programmed to ignore metal objects, certain types of plants, specific morphs, females, or specific individuals.
Swarms may either be released directly from a hive or from pre\-packaged programmable canisters.

Swarms must be programmed before they are released.
The programming first determines how long the swarm is active.
This timeframe is open\-ended, though most swarms deteriorate into ineffectiveness after 2 weeks unless they are replenished by a hive.
The programming then sets what area the swarm is to occupy.
This is also open to interpretation and can vary from \[lq]coat this person\[rq] to \[lq]spread out to a diameter of 20 meters\[rq] to \[lq]find the nearest chemical traces and track them to their source.\[rq] Finally, programming sets any other parameters for the
swarm's mission \[em] for example, if it should ignore certain materials, if it should send a report at a predetermined time, or if it should self\-destruct into harmless dust when it has completed a certain task.

Programming is generally handled as a Simple Success Test using Programming (Nanoswarm) skill.
Failure simply infers that the programming is imperfect, and so the swarm may not operate completely as planned.
An actual Programming (Nanoswarm) Success Test is only called for if the swarm's programming is substantially complex or if the character seeks to have the swarm act outside of its usual set functions.
The bots in each swarm are specially equipped for the task they are designed for, however, so attempting to drastically repurpose a swarm may be difficult or pointless at the gamemaster's discretion.

Swarms may also be teleoperated, controlled, and/ or (re)programmed once they are released, via radio or laser link.

Swarms are treated as a whole.
The standard swarm size is enough to cover a 10 × 10 × 10 meter cube, and this is the standard \[lq]unit\[rq] of swarm released by a canister or hive.
Swarms may be larger, but they are treated as individual swarm units.
Each swarm has a Durability of 50 and is immune to wounds.
Most attacks against a swarm simply floor 1 point of damage.
Area\-effect weapons, plasma rifles, and fire floor 1d10 damage, plasma grenades do full damage.
EMP weapons (p. 340) are very effective against swarms, flooring 2d10 + 5 damage and a \-10 modifier to all tests due to their damaging effects on the swarm's communication abilities until repaired.
Swarms are not affected by vacuum.

Spindles can also reabsorb their cable, retracting it at a rate of 5 m per second.
As long as it is recharged and has small amounts of additional material added every 1,000 hours of use, a spindle can keep producing and retracting cable indefinitely.

Most vacuum suits are skin\-tight garments that use the pressure of their advanced smartfabrics on the wearer's body to resist vacuum.
When the wearer is in a breathable atmosphere, the smartfabric also loosens the suits to serve as ordinary clothing or be easily put on or taken off.
In all cases, the suits can become skin\-tight within 3 Action Turns.
All vacsuits contain advanced rebreather units capable of maintaining a breathable atmosphere for several hours or days.

.HP 1
\f[B]Light Vacsuit:\f[] Everyone living in a sealed habitat owns at least one of these suits.

Inexpensive versions are typically lightweight jumpsuits made of simple smart fabric that adjusts to fit and folds up small enough to fit into a coat pocket.
The best models include suits of high\-end smart clothing that can transform into a vacsuit and an advanced nanotech generator the size of a large orange that deploy nanobots that cover the user and fit together into a vacuum suit.
Both can transform into a vacsuit in 2 full Action Turns and do so either on command or if their sensors reveal that life support is needed.

All models include a lightweight belt or torc containing a miniature oxygen tank and advanced rebreather unit that provides 3 hours of air.
However, the suits contain no food or water recycling.
All models include an ecto (p. 325) and a headlight, but typically little else beyond atmosphere sensors to let the wearer know when it is safe to take off the suit.
They protect the wearer from temperatures from \-75 to 100 deg C.

.SS Kinetic weapons

Kinetic weapons damage the target by firing a hard impact projectile at high\-velocities.
Slugthrowers have evolved from the mechanical firearms of the early 21st century, however, and now fall into two categories: chemical firearms and railguns.
Though their mechanisms for firing are different, they are roughly similar in effect.
Railguns have a higher penetration and inflict more damage, which is offset by more limited ammunition choices.
While modern beam weapons have their uses, they rarely match the punch of kinetic weapons, therefore slugthrowers are still perceived as the most versatile and effective weapon system.

Kinetic weapons are constructed from lightweight, reinforced plastoceramic materials, which are easily produced even without nanofabrication.
By default, modern kinetic weapons are ambidextrous but more importantly feature safety and smartlink systems (p. 342) that automatically connect to the wielder's mesh inserts for firing assistance, target recognition, and tactical networking.

The wielder of a firearm or railgun uses Kinetic Weapons skill.
For information on firing modes, see p. 198.
For different ammunition types, see p. 336.
Ranges are listed on p. 203.

\fBFirearms\fR

.RS 1
Modern chemical firearms use caseless ammunition that is auto\-loaded from a magazine.
They are effectively recoilless (thanks to rheological smart fluid mechanisms) and electronically fired (an electric charge vaporizes the propellant, using the expanding steam and plasma to eject and accelerate the projectile).
Note that older, pre\-Fall firearms still exist and are traded by black marketeers, though they use outdated system such as liquid propellants or cased ammunition.
At the gamemaster's discretion, these relics may suffer shorter ranges, less penetration, fewer firing modes, or reduced damage.

\fBRailguns\fR

.RS 1
Railguns use a pair of electromagnetic rails to slide and accelerate a non\-explosive conductive projectile at extremely high velocities (Mach 6+) to create an overwhelming, penetrating attack.
The kinetic energy of the projectile exceeds that of an explosive\-filled shell of greater mass and creates shock and heat waves upon impact that shatter and incinerate the target, or portions of it.
While railguns are more potent than firearms, the ammunition choices are limited as the projectile must be conductive and able to survive both acceleration and heat created in the process due to friction.
Nanofabrication allows railguns to be manufactured on the personal weapons scale while high\-energy portable batteries provide the power to fire them.
Railgun operation is silent except for the supersonic crack of the projectile.

Railguns are available in the same models as firearms (pistols through machine guns), with the following modifications:
.IP \[bu] 2
Increase AP by \-3
.IP \[bu] 2

.IP \[bu] 2
Railguns may only use regular and armor\-piercing ammunition
.IP \[bu] 2
Railguns also require battery power for each shot.
Standard railgun batteries hold enough power for 200 shots, after which they must be recharged at the rate of 20 points per hour.

.SS Brand name weapons and combined arms

The weapons listed in this book define generic samples of each weapon.
Gamemasters are encouraged to offer brand name versions of each weapon, each with its particular idiosyncrasies and small variations.
For example, a Direct Action A30 SMG might lack a semi\-automatic setting but come equipped with an extra ammo capacity of 35.
Likewise, a Medusan Arms Longinus sniper rifle may inflict an extra +2 damage but have an AP of only \-12.

Similarly, many of the weapons listed here are available as combined arms weapons systems.
A police\-issue assault rifle may also feature a stunner \[em] all built into the same weapon.
For combined arms, simply add together the individual weapon component costs.

.SS Beam weapons

Beam weapons is a broad category for a number of electromagnetic weapons with a wide range of effects.
With a few exceptions, energy weapons are primarily used for less\-than\-lethal purposes, designed to impair the target rather than kill it.
Their poor performance against armor, lesser ability to damage targets, and high power requirements make them less versatile than kinetic weapons.
All beam weapons come with built-in safety and smartlink systems.
The wielders of such weapons use Beam Weapons skill.

.HP 1
\fBBatteries:\fR Beam weapons are equipped with both a standard and nuclear battery.
The standard battery is good for the listed number of shots before it is depleted.
The nuclear battery will recharge the standard battery completely in five hours.
Standard batteries may be swapped out with a Simple Action.
\fB[Trivial (Standard) or Low (Nuclear)]\fR
.RE

.HP 1
\f[B]Laser Pulsers:\f[] Laser weapons use focused beams of light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it and causing it's outer surface to vaporize and expand, creating an explosive effect.
The laser beam is pulsed in order to bite into the target before the beam is diffused.
Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however \[em] the gamemaster should reduce their effective range categories as appropriate.
Note that laser pulses are invisible in the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to characters with enhanced vision).
Pulsers are medium\-sized (p. 297) and fire in semi\-auto mode.
\f[B][Moderate]\f[]
.RE

.RS 1
One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed in less\-lethal mode.
In this case, it first fires a pulse at the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a flash\-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target.
This blast has an area of effect with a 1\-meter radius.
Anyone caught in the blast must make a \fISOM × 2\fR Test (\fISOM × 3\fR for synthmorphs or biomorphs with any form of pain tolerance).
Failure means the target is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses their next action.
A critical failure means the target is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per 10 points of MoF.
In this stun setting, the pulser fires only in single\-shot mode.
.RE

.HP 1
\f[B]Microwave Agonizer:\f[] The agonizer fires millimeterwave beams that create an unpleasant burning sensation in skin (even through armor) and to metals.
Agonizers have two settings.
The first is an active denial setting that causes extreme burning pain in the target, inflicting \-20 to the target's actions and forcing them to move away from the beam on their next action unless they succeed in a WIL Test (targets with Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only
suffer a \-10 modifier and roll \fIWIL × 2\fR).
Synthetic morphs and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the equivalent) are immune to this weapon.
The second setting (colloquially known as the \[lq]roast\[rq] setting) has the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the target,
inflicting the listed damage.
Originally developed for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for repelling animals.
The agonizer is small\-sized (p. 297) and fires in semi\-auto mode.
\f[B][Moderate]\f[]
.RE

.HP 1
\f[B]Particle Beam Bolter:\f[] This weapon shoots a bolt of accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, superheating and creating an explosion when striking.
The bolter's beam is not diffused by the cloud that occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetration than the laser pulser.
Likewise, the bolter is not affected by smoke, fog, or rain.
The bolter's beam is invisible.
Note that bolters are designed for either atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation, and will not function in the opposite environment (though bulkier dual models, combining both models, are also available).
Bolters fire in semi\-auto mode and are rifle\-sized two\-handed weapons.
\f[B][High]\f[]
.RE

.HP 1
\f[B]Plasma Rifle:\f[] This bulky, heavy, two\-handed weapon blasts a stream of nova\-hot plasma at the target, inflicting severe burns and thermal damage, possibly melting or evaporating the target entirely.
Plasma rifles are perhaps the deadliest man\-portable weapons in use.
Plasma guns suffer from dangerous overheating, however, and so require 1 full Action Turn of cool\-down time after every 2 shots.
Plasma rifles only fire in single shot mode.
\fB[Expensive]\fR
.RE

.HP 1
\fBStunner:\fR
The stunner is an electrolaser that creates an electrically\-conductive plasma channel to the target, down which it transmits a powerful electric current, shocking the target.
Stunners do not work in vacuum.
Stunners fire in semi\-auto mode.

.SS Seekers

Seekers are a combination of automatic grenade launcher, micromissile, coilgun, and smart munitions technology.
Unlike traditional launchers of the past, miniaturization allows the manufacture of seeker micromissile launchers in personal weapon sizes.
Seeker rounds are fired at high\-velocity via rings of magnetic coils, after which the micromissile or minimissile uses scramjet technology to propel itself and maintain high velocities over great distances.
Seekers are wielded using Seeker Weapon skill.

Seeker missiles are detailed on p. 340.
Like grenades, seekers may be programmed for a variety of trigger events (see Grenades and Seekers, p. 199).
All seeker weapons are smartlink\-equipped (p. 342).

.SS Grenades and seekers

Grenades and seeker missiles come in similar munitions packages and with similar trigger mechanisms, though their packaging, physical form, and methods of application differ.
Seeker missiles are fired from a seeker launcher (p. 339) using Seeker Weapons skill.
Grenades are thrown at targets using Throwing Weapons skill.
If a grenade or seeker misses, use the rules for scatter (p. 204).

Grenades are available in standard form or as microgrenades.
Similarly, missiles are available in standard, minimissile, or micromissile sizes.
Standard grenades and minimissiles are the baseline standard for listed effects.
All are area effect weapons (p. 193).
Minigrenades and micromissiles inflict \-1d10 damage (or have another decreased effect as noted).
Standard missiles double the listed DV.
For weapons with a uniform blast effect or other static blast area, divide the base listed radius in half for minigrenades and micromissiles and double it for standard missiles.
Listed costs are for 10 grenades/missiles.

Each seeker has one smart ammo option (p. 338) other than biter or flayer.

.SS Exotic ranged weapons

These weapons are either rare or distinctly separate from other weapons types.
These weapons are wielded with an Exotic Ranged Weapon skill of the appropriate field.

.HP 1
\f[B]Vortex Ring Gun:\f[] This less\-lethal two\-handed weapon detonates a blank cartridge and accelerates the explosive pressure down a widening barrel so that it develops into a high\-speed vortex ring \[em] a spinning, donut\-shaped blast vortex.
This concussive blast is used to knock down and incapacitate close\-range targets.
Struck targets suffer a \-10 action modifier for the rest of that Action Turn and must must succeed in a \fISOM × 2\fR Test or fall down.
If their MoF is 30+, they are additionally stunned and unable to act until the end of the next Action Turn.
Drugs, chemicals, and similar agents may be loaded into the charge as well.

\f[B]Smartlink:\f[] A smartlink system connects the weapon to the user's mesh inserts, placing a targeting bracket in the character's field of vision and providing range and targeting information.
Apply a +10 modifier to the Attack Test.
Smartlinks also incorporate a microcamera that allows the user to see what the weapon is pointed at, fire around corners, etc.
Smartlinks also allow certain other types of weapon system control, such as changing flux ammo (p. 337) or programming seeker trigger conditions (p. 199).
\f[B][Moderate]\f[]
.RE

.HP 1
\f[B]Smart Magazine:\f[] A smart magazine allows the character to pick and choose what ammo round will be fired with each shot.

.SH Robots and vehicles

The following is a small selection of the many vehicles in use in the solar system.
Almost all of the vehicles in current use, including all of the vehicles listed here, have built\-in AIs capable of piloting the vehicle under almost all circumstances.
In most cases, passengers simply state their destination and the vehicle takes them there.
Manual piloting is primarily used in emergencies or by people who prefer the exotic thrill of controlling their own vehicle.

Rules for handling robots and vehicles are detailed on p. 195.
Any of these shells may be modified for use as a synthetic morph by adding a cyberbrain system (p. 300).
Each of the shells listed here comes with a puppet sock (p. 307) for remote\-control operation.

.SS Aircraft

On Mars, Venus, and within large open\-space habitats like O'Neil cylinders, aircraft of various kinds see regular use.
This includes modern version of rotorcraft (helicopters, autogyros, tilt\-rotors), fixed\-wing planes, and zeppelins and other lighter\-than\-air craft.
These are typically propelled by turbofan or jet engines, rotors, or vectored thrust.
These vehicles are piloted with Pilot: Aircraft skill.
Microlight: This ultra\-light personal aircraft is not much more than a strut\-based wing, an airframe, and an electric propeller engine.
They are ideal for getting around inside large habitats with enclosed airspace.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
\f[B]Portable Plane:\f[] Powered by superconducting batteries and with an exceedingly small but powerful electric motor, this light but durable propeller plane is made of smart materials that allow it to be swiftly folded up into a small portable package.
Different versions are designed for flight on Mars, Titan, or Venus, each taking 10 minutes to assemble or disassemble.
The Martian version unpacks into an airplane with a wingspan of 11 m with a top speed of 250 kph and a cruising speed of 220 kph and a range of 1,300 km.
The Venusian version has a wingspan of 9 m, a top speed of 200 kph and a range of 1,000 km.
The version designed for use on Titan has a wingspan of 8 m and has a top speed of 200 kph and a range of 2,000 km.
In all versions, the two occupants ride in an inflatable and insulated pressurized bubble with a life support system capable of providing clean air and comfortable temperatures for 20 hours on Mars and Venus, and 15 hours on Titan.
\f[B][High]\f[]
\f[B]Rocket Buggy:\f[] This vehicle is the most common form of medium to long distance personal transport on Luna, and is in common on most other moons and large asteroids.
On these airless worlds, a rocket buggy can reach orbit and return or take a parabolic path to any destination on that moon in less than an hour.
This vehicle is also regularly used to travel between habitats that are less than 30,000 km apart.
The vehicle is pressurized, but is designed for short duration travel only.
The seats are relatively small and the life support system contains no provisions for recycling food or water and can only support the passengers for an absolute maximum of 50 uncomfortable hours.
Rockets buggies come equipped with headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of up to 250 km.

A version of this vehicle is also used on both Mars and Titan, but here the frame has been modified to act as a lifting body, and it has a top speed in the thin Martian atmosphere of 2,500 km/hour and a range of 8,000 km on Mars.
On Titan is has a top speed of 3,000 kph in the atmosphere, but it can also reach orbit.
\f[B][Expensive]\f[]
\f[B]Small Jet:\f[] Methane\-powered jet planes are one of the most common forms of fast transport on Mars and Venus.
Similar planes are used on Titan, except that they carry both liquid methane and liquid oxygen.
These jets range in size from huge vehicles the size of late 20th\-century airliners to small planes designed to carry half a dozen passengers.
All jets are made using smart materials, so that their wings and frames can adapt to a wide range of speeds and altitudes.
One common small jet has similar versions in use on Venus, Mars, and Titan, has a single jet engine and has a life support system capable of providing air for up to 100 hours.
The Venusian and Martian versions both have a top speed of 900 kph, a wingspan of 11 m, and a maximum range of 5,000 km.
The version designed for Titan has a wingspan of 8 m, a top speed of 650 kph, and a range of 4,000 km.
Jets are equipped with headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of up to 250 km.

.SS Exoskeletons

Exoskeletons are powered mechatronic skeleton frameworks worn by a person.
Servo\-hydraulic joints allow the exoskeleton to be maneuvered by mimicking the wearer's own movements, as well as enhancing their strength.
Exoskeletons may also be piloted electronically.
A character wearing an exoskeleton (other than the trike or transporter) maneuvers as normal, because the exoskeleton is like an extension of their own body.
A character jamming an exoskeleton remotely uses Pilot: Walker skill (except for the trike and transporter).

\f[B]Battle Suit:\f[] The battle suit powered exoskeleton features a military\-grade fullerene armor shell with flexible aerogel for thermal insulation and a diamond\-hardened exterior designed to resist even potent ballistic and energy\-based weapons.
The suit also enhances the wearer's strength and mobility, applying a +10 bonus to strength\-based tests, inflicting an extra +1d10 damage and AP of \-2 on melee attacks, and doubling the distance by which the character may jump.
Battlesuits are completely sealed to protect the wearer from environmental factors, and fitted with life support features and a maker (p. 327) capable of recycling all wastes and producing air for up to 48 hours and food and water indefinitely.
Battle suits are equipped with each an ecto (p. 325), a radio booster (p. 313), and sensors equal to specs (see p. 325).
These suits have an Armor Value of 18/18 (not cumulative with any other armor) and protect the wearer from temperatures from \-175 to 140 deg C.
\f[B][Expensive]\f[]
\f[B]Exowalker:\f[] Exowalkers are minimal framework exoskeletons, primarily designed to bolster the wearer's strength and movement.
They provide a an Armor Value of 2/4, a +10 modifier to strength\-based tests, and double the distance by which the character may jump.
\f[B][Moderate]\f[]
\f[B]Hyperdense Exoskeleton:\f[] These powered exoskeletons are larger (roughly twice human\-sized) and built for heavy\-use industrial purposes, such as handling heavy/large objects.
The wearer is partially encapsulated to protect them from debris and industrial accidents.
Hyperdense exoskeletons provide no movement bonus, but provide a +30 bonus to strength\-based tests and inflict an extra +3d10 damage and \-5 AP on physical attacks.
They have an Armor Value of 6/12.
\f[B][Expensive]\f[]
\f[B]Transporter:\f[] This exoskeleton framework includes a pair of vector\-thrust turbofan engines, giving the user flight capabilities in gravity and increased maneuverability in zero\-G.
It provides partial protection to the wearer with an Armor Value of 2/4.
Piloted with Pilot: Aircraft skill.
\f[B][High]\f[]
\f[B]Trike:\f[] The trike exoskeleton is a three\-wheeled personal motorcycle design, rather than a walker.
It provides partial protection to the wearer with an Armor Value of 2/4.
Piloted with Pilot: Groundrcraft skill.

.SS Groundcraft

In Eclipse Phase, trains and bicycles remain the most common form of ground transportation, especially on habitats.
In larger habitats and on moons and planets, cycles and cars are used as well.

\f[B]Cycle:\f[] Because of the high cost of enclosing a habitat and providing life support, space is at a premium in all cities except some of the newest cities on Mars.
As a result, there is rarely room for large roads or the cars that once carpeted the roads of Earthly cities.
Instead, the ubiquitous modern vehicle is the cycle, which is designed to drive down narrow streets only a little wider than sidewalks in Earth cities.

There are many different varieties of cycle.
Some have only a single wheel and are gyro\-stabilized, but most have two wheels and resemble old Earth motorcycles.
In some, the driver and passenger are enclosed by a streamlined pod.
These vehicles are powered by superconducting batteries, have a range of 600 km and a top speed of 120 kph, but must usually drive more slowly in crowded streets.
Cycles are all equipped with radio boosters, headlights, and a portable radar sensor.
Tires are solid state (not inflated), or in some cases smart spokes capable of handling stairs.
Some luxury versions have limited life\-support in the small cabin, capable of providing air for the passengers for up to 10 hours.
\f[B][Moderate]\f[]
\f[B]Mars Buggy:\f[] One of the most ubiquitous vehicles on Mars is the so\-called Mars buggy, a four\-wheeled vehicle with large balloon tires that is designed for use both on roads and on almost any terrain.
Mars buggies can travel at speed of up to 110 kph on roads, 90 kph over relatively flat terrain, and up to 40 kph on jagged and rocky terrain.
They can maintain these speeds because smart materials in both the suspension and the tires reshape themselves to adapt to uneven conditions and their nuclear batteries give them an effectively unlimited range.
Most Mars buggies are enclosed but unpressurized.
Similar vehicles are used on Luna and Titan, however, though the passenger compartments of these vehicles includes life support gear that provides the occupants with air for at least 100 hours.
Buggies are powered by nuclear batteries and come in a variety of sizes, from small two\-person buggies to large trucks.
Mars buggies come equipped with headlights, radio boosters, and a vehicle radar system.
\f[B][High]\f[]
.SS Personal vehicles

These one\-person movement aids primarily are used in space, but do not count as spacecraft per se.

\f[B]EVA Sled:\f[] This small sled uses air impellers to maneuver in zero\-G.
It is commonly used to carry attached gear, but may also pull along 1 human\-sized morph.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
\f[B]Rocket Pack:\f[] This is a miniature metallic hydrogen rocket that the wearer straps to their back, with two rocket exhausts extending out to either side, away from the wearer's body or legs.
Biomorphs and pod morphs can only safely use this vehicle when wearing a vacuum suit or some garment that is similarly heat resistant.
Also, to prevent harm to the wearer, the thrust must be kept sufficiently low that it can only take off on Mars or moons with even lower gravity.
A rocket pack can keep the wearer airborne for up to 15 minutes in Mars gravity, or 30 minutes on Luna, Titan, or any of the four large Jovian moons.
On Mars, it has a maximum speed of 700 kph.
It can be used to reach orbit and land again on Luna, Titan, and other similarly small bodies like the Jovian moons.
Rocket packs are equipped with radio boosters but no other sensors or communication devices.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
\f[B]Thruster Pack:\f[] Worn for EVA duties, this thruster pack uses vectored thrust nozzles, allowing a character to maneuver in open space.
This is not a jetpack and does not produce enough thrust for atmospheric movement.

.SS Robots

Robots are a common sight and accepted fact of daily life within Eclipse Phase.
Numerous varieties exist, from robo\-pets to mechanical workers to warbots.
If a job can be done more cheaply (and sometimes safely) by a bot, it usually is.
The robots listed here are not generally used as synthetic shells by transhuman egos, often for cultural reasons (sleeving a case is bad enough, sleeving a creepy is just ...
wrong), and they are not equipped to be sleeved into (though the may be jammed; see p. 196).
Any of these bots may be modified for use as a synthetic morph, however, by adding a cyberbrain system (p. 300).

\f[B]Automech:\f[] Automechs are general purpose repair drones, found just about everywhere.
Each particular automech tends to specialize in a particular type of repair work and so carries the appropriate tools and AI skills, whether it be habitat waste recyclers, outer hull integrity, or servitor systems.
Standard automechs are wheeled cubes with articulated limbs, though they are also equipped with vectored\-thrust drives for zero\-G work.
\f[B][Moderate]\f[]
\f[B]Creepy:\f[] Creepies are small crawler bots that come in an eclectic variety of shapes and forms, from robosquirrels to insectoids to bizarre and artsy mechanical creatures.
Creepies were originally designed as a sort of robotic pet, but they are commonly used as a general purpose household minion, like a more beloved servitor.
Many people in fact wear a creepy on their person, dropping it to handle small tasks for them and letting it crawl up and down and over their body.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
\f[B]Dr. Bot:\f[] These wheeled medical robots are designed to tend to and transport injured or sick people.
They carry a healing vat (p. 326), a specialized pharmaceuticals maker, miscellaneous medical gear, and articulated arms for conducting remote surgery.
\f[B][High]\f[]
\f[B]Dwarf:\f[] These large industrial bots are named not just for their primary use \[em] mining, excavation, tunneling, and construction \[em] but because the default AIs they shipped with had a programmed tendency to happily whistle as they worked.
Dwarfs are quadrapedal walkers, equipped with massive modular industrial tools like boring drills, shovels, hydraulic jacks, jackhammers, scooping arms, acid sprays, and so on.
\f[B][Expensive]\f[]
\f[B]Gnat:\f[] Gnats are small rotorcraft camera/surveillance drones.
Many people use gnats for personal lifelogging, while socialites and media use them to capture the glamor or hottest news.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
\f[B]Guardian Angel:\f[] Similar to gnats, guardian angel rotorcraft hover around their charges, keeping a watchful eye out to protect them from threats.
\f[B][Moderate]\f[]
\f[B]Saucer:\f[] These disc\-shaped drones are lightweight and quiet.
They are typically launched by throwing them like a frisbee, after which they propel themselves with an ionic drive (p. 310).
Saucers make excellent \[lq]eye in the sky\[rq] monitors and scouts.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
\f[B]Servitor:\f[] Servitors are the most common robot, acting as cooks, janitors, universal helpers, movers, and personal aides.
Every home has one, if not several.
Servitors are intentionally built in non\-humanoid forms so as not to confuse them with common synthmorphs and in order to defuse bad feelings at ordering them around.
However, they all have some form of \[lq]face\[rq] to interact with, so as not to be too machine\-like.
\f[B][Low]\f[]
\f[B]Speck:\f[] Specks are tiny insectoid spy drones, 2.5 mm long and 2 mm wide, about the size of a small fruit fly.
They fly with tiny wings, carry a microbug, and are excellent for surveillance purposes or otherwise being a \[lq]speck on a wall.\[rq] Specks are difficult to notice (\-30 Perception modifier) and almost impossible to distinguish from an actual insect.

Though egocasting is a common method of personal transport and it's often easier to simply transmit the specifications for various goods and to allow nanofactories to create duplicates, spacecraft play an important role in the solar system, carrying both passengers and
valuable cargo.
Both in terms of materials and propulsion, spacecraft in the post\-Fall era are far superior to the primitive vessels used in the 20th and early 21st centuries, but they are still based on the same principles.

Spacecraft have few stats in \f[I]Eclipse Phase\f[], as they are primarily handled as setting rather than vehicles.
Note also that no stats are given for spacecraft weaponry.
It is highly recommended that space combat be handled as a plot device rather than a combat scene, given the extreme lethality and danger involved.
If you absolutely must know the DV of a spacecraft weapon, treat it as a a standard weapon with a DV multiplier of x3 for small craft (fighters and shuttles), x5 for medium craft, and x10 for larger craft.

.SS Spacecraft propulsion

The most important part of any spacecraft is its engine, and the most important features of any engine are the exhaust velocity, which determines how much fuel the rocket requires to reach a given speed, and the engine's thrust, which determines how high the acceleration can be.
Any rocket that has a thrust of less than approximately twice the gravity of a planet or moon cannot take off from that planet or moon.
Sample thrusts and gravities are listed on the \f[I]Escaping Gravity Wells\f[] table, p. 346.

\f[B]Hydrogen\-Oxygen Rocket (HO):\f[] Though optimized with improved engine design and light\-weight materials, these are essentially the same primitive rockets that humanity used to first reach the moon in the 20th century.
These are rarely used and only common with groups too poor or primitive to safely manufacture metallic hydrogen.

\f[B]Metallic Hydrogen Rocket (MH):\f[] Metallic hydrogen is a solid form of hydrogen created using exceedingly high pressures.
Although naturally unstable, it can be stabilized with carefully controlled electrical and magnetic fields, and these field generators are an integral part of every metallic hydrogen fuel tank.
By selectively reducing these fields near the exhaust nozzle, small amounts of metallic hydrogen can be made to swiftly and explosively revert to conventional hydrogen gas, propelling the rocket with great force in an easily controlled fashion.
Metallic hydrogen engines are used in most planetary landers and short range vehicles.

\f[B]Plasma Rocket (P):\f[] This drive heats hydrogen into plasma and accelerates it using a powerful electrical field.
This type of rocket was very common in the mid 21st century, but has been superseded by fusion rockets and is only used in older and more primitive spacecraft, notably scum barges.

\f[B]Fusion Rocket (F):\f[] Similar to a plasma rockets, fusion rockets require significantly higher temperatures and pressures, and the rocket also produces large amounts of power for the spacecraft.
Fusion rockets are now the most common form of propulsion for spacecraft designed for long\-distance voyages.

\f[B]Anti\-Matter Rocket (AM):\f[] Anti\-matter rockets work mixing small amounts of anti\-matter into the hydrogen fuel, producing enormous amounts of energy and an exceptionally fast and powerful exhaust.
These rockets typically carry a heavily shielded magnetically contained anti\-matter storage vessel carrying a mass of anti\-matter equal to 1% of the mass of the hydrogen fuel used by the rocket.
The magnetic containment vessels needed to safely contain antimatter usually weight at least 10 times the mass of the antimatter used.

Though anti\-matter storage is exceptionally safe, the vast energy release possible if there was an accident means that anti\-matter rockets are forbidden from coming closer than 25,000 km from any inhabited planet or moon.
Also, very few habitats will allow an anti\-matter rocket to dock with them, and instead require the spacecraft to remain at least 10,000 km away and for all cargo and passengers to be transferred using a small craft like a small LOTV.
Anti\-matter is exceedingly expensive to produce and so anti\-matter rockets are only used in military vessels and in fast couriers designed to carry critical cargoes across the solar system in short periods of time.

.SS Sample spacecraft

The following is a representative sample of the most common type of spacecraft used in the solar system today.

\f[B]Bulk Carrier:\f[] This vessel is simply a standard transport refitted to carry large amounts of cargo in external cargo grapples.
Used for carrying refined ores, ice, and similar forms of large, useful, but low priority cargos, bulk carriers transport large cargos at relatively low velocities.
They also offer an inexpensive, reliable, and slow method for passengers to travel from one habitat to another and are not infrequently used by individuals who wish to disappear for a while.
Unlike the standard transport, the bulk carrier lacks the rotating habitat pods.

\f[B]Courier:\f[] In a standard transport, a typical journey from Luna to Mars requires approximately three weeks, while a journey from Mars to Jupiter requires approximately four months.
This is sufficient for most purposes, but occasionally characters need to take themselves or sufficiently valuable cargoes across the solar system in a matter of days or weeks, instead of weeks or months.

Anti\-matter drive fast couriers are vessels designed for this specific purpose.
This vessel can travel from Venus to Mars in a week and from Mars to Jupiter in a month.
The fast courier is the swiftest vessels currently made and is able to reach at much as one half of one percent of the speed of light.
To manage this, this spacecraft must also carry 6 tons of antimatter in a 100 ton magnetic containment vessel.
In an emergency, this containment facility can be jettisoned.

\f[B]Destroyer:\f[] One of the largest military spacecraft in common use, destroyers use an antimatter drive holding 150 tons of antimatter in a 2,000\-ton magnetic containment vessel.
This antimatter can also be used to provide the spacecraft's missiles with anti\-matter for devastatingly powerful anti\-matter warheads.
This spacecraft is also armed with railguns, nuclear and high explosive missiles, and point defense lasers.
In addition, all destroyers carry a contingent of 20 fighters.

\f[B]Fighter:\f[] This small, short range military vessel is designed to be crewed by an infomorph or AI.
If needed, however, it can hold a single synthmorph or vaccumadapted biomorph as a pilot.
It carries 3 lasers and 2 railguns mounted on small pods placed around the middle of ship that can fire in any direction.
A single missile launcher is located in the nose of the fighter and typically holds 6 small high explosive missiles or tactical nuclear missiles (or even anti\-matter missiles if facing high\-threat targets).

\f[B]General Exploration Vehicle (GEV):\f[] A GEV is one of the standard vehicles used for exploration beyond the Pandora Gates.
It is specifically designed to handle almost any environment.
It is a boxy vehicle, 6 meters long, 2.2 meters wide, and 2 meters high.
It makes extensive use of smart matter in the lower part of the chassis, and can create wheels or short legs (primarily useful for exceedingly rough terrain).
It can even produce limited hull streamlining and propulsion suitable for travel both on and underwater.
In addition, it contains a small metallic hydrogen engine that allow it to maneuver in space with an acceleration of up to 0.1 G.
GEVs have a Maximum Velocity of 200 (wheeled)/40 (walker)/60 (sea)/40 (submerged).

The GEV also has a closed cycle life support system that can support up to 6 (fairly cramped) living occupants for up to one month and limited electromagnetic shielding against charged particle radiation.
All models are fitted with advanced AI piloting and navigation as well as limited self\-repair capacity.
In addition, GEV's have an extensible airlock, a single healing vat, several desktop CMs, and a variety of sensors, including both radar and telescopic full spectrum cameras.

\f[B]Large Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (LLOTV):\f[] This common vehicle is used for transporting passengers and cargo between a planet or moon and orbit and for short distance transfers between habitats less than 100,000 km apart.
This conical vehicle has a curved heat shield on the base and smart material landing legs and grapples so that it can rest securely on any stable terrain and link up with all forms of docking clamps.
It comes in variants designed to use either a hydrogen\-oxygen chemical rocket or a metallic hydrogen rocket.
The use of light\-weight smart materials allows the interior to be easily and rapidly reconfigured to accommodate different amounts of fuel, passenger seats, and cargo space.
LLOTVs that are not designed for planetary landing or which are designed only to land on airless moons are unstreamlined and look considerably blockier.

LLOTVs come in two configurations: high or low velocity.
High velocity configuration allows the vehicle to land and take off again on Venus or Earth without refueling and for rapid transport between nearby habitats.
Low velocity configuration is designed to land and take off again on Mars or various large moons without refueling and for slower and more fuel efficient transport between nearby habitats.
The extensive use of smart materials in this vehicle means that LLOTVs that use metallic hydrogen engines can be easily converted between the high and low velocity configurations, requiring less than a day in a wellequipped maintenance facility.
However, vessels using hydrogen oxygen engines cannot be converted.
Since metallic hydrogen is a much more efficient propellant, landers using it always include significant amounts of extra propellant for emergencies.

\f[B]Scum Barge:\f[] These huge craft were originally designed for use during the first stages of the evacuation of Earth.
They were built to carry up to 20,000 people and to allow them to survive for months or even years, in relatively cramped conditions, until more suitable habitats could be constructed.
A number of these vessels are still in service, primarily used as mobile habitats by various anarchic subcultures.
The best have had their plasma rockets replaced by modern fusion rockets and carry 5\-10,000 in relative comfort.
The worst use aging plasma rockets and stretch their life support systems and living spaces to the limit, carrying up to 25,000 poor and desperate residents.

\f[B]Small Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (SLOTV):\f[] This vehicle is identical in use and design to the LLOTV, except that it is one third the total mass and correspondingly less expensive to build and refuel.
Some exceptionally wealthy individuals own private small LOTVs.
Using a small LOTV with a hydrogenoxygen engine to take off and land on Venus or for other high velocity uses is exceptionally cramped and allows for absolutely no room for error.
Like the LLOTV, this vehicle can be easily converted between low and high velocity configurations and is made in both streamlined and non\-streamlined versions.

\f[B]Standard Transport:\f[] This vessel is one of the most common freighter and passenger vessel in the solar system.
While egocasting is by far the most common form of inter\-habitat transport, some people prefer to travel by ship and others do not wish to leave their current morph behind.
In addition, some goods are easier or cheaper to physically transport rather than duplicating their templates.
As a result, standard transports regularly travel to and from every large habitat and inhabited planet and moon in the solar system.
These are modern fusion\-drive ships that offer fast and comfortable travel for passengers as well as relatively swift transport for small cargoes.

One of the additional benefits of the standard transport is the fact that it contains four separate passenger compartments, each of which is mounted on a 90 meter\-long booms that can extend and rotate to simulate gravity.
When rotating at a comfortable 2 rpm, passengers experience Mars level gravity.
Typically, the gravity maintained in these pods starts at the local gravity (or Mars gravity, if the local gravity is higher) and over the course of the journey gradually increases or decreases to the gravity of the destination.
However, these pods cannot rotate to produce gravity higher than that found on Mars.
