.SH Dedication
This book is dedicated first and foremost to the people who made Eclipse Phase happen, from everyone who contributed time, sweat, ideas, and money into it to everyone who picks it up, reads it, and plays it. This game is by you and for you. Secondly it's dedicated to my grandmother and to Andrea, both important people in my life who died while I was working on this book and its themes of defeating death. I sincerely hope that one day such tragic losses are avoided. Third, this book is dedicated to my son Echo, my entertaining working companion on this project. Finally this book is dedicated to those visionaries, especially the anarchists and transhumanists, who are working to bring about a fantastic future, starting now. \[em]Rob Boyle
