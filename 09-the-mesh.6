.TH "The Mesh" "Eclipse Phase"

Before the Fall, humanity interfaced with each other through the
internet, interconnected networks that served as the technical backbone
for the evolving world wide web.
While it began as a electronic medium for retrieving information from
various sources (replacing even older paper\-based infosources),
succeeding generations emphasized digital communities and hosted
services such as networking sites, wikis, blogs, and folksonomies.
These facilitated openness, collaboration, and sharing, thereby laying
the groundwork for a modern, interconnected information society.
Further stages emphasized wireless interaction, geolocation, and
semantic web approaches and achieved quantum leaps in the realm of user
interaction with the advent of brain\-computer interfaces, augmented
reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and experience playback (XP).

This environment, coupled with the exponential growth of processing
power and memory storage, created an evolutionary path for the
development of intelligent agents\[em]designed to augment human
information processing\[em]that then transformed into artificial
intelligences (AIs) in the following decades.
While these \[lq]weak\[rq] AIs did not possess the full range of
humancognitive abilities, tended towards overspecialization, and were
restrained by programmed limitations, the digital evolution toward
artificial general intelligences (AGIs)\[em]”strong” AIs with
intelligence capabilities that equaled or exceeded human
abilities\[em]could not be halted.
From this point it was but a matter of time before so\-called seed AI
would come into existence, machine minds capable of recursive
self\-improvement, leading to an exponential growth in intelligence.
Unfortunately for humanity, the TITANs were the result.

Even before the Fall, however, the internet of old was transforming into
something new.
Instead of connecting via central servers, users were wirelessly linking
to each other, creating a decentralized intermeshed network of handheld
devices, personal computers, robots, and electronic devices.
Users were online all of the time and connected with everything and
everyone around them in a ubiquitous computing environment.
This was especially true of those participating in humanity's expansion
into space.
Disconnected from the internet due to distance and light\-speed
communication lags, these users were nevertheless connected with all of
the people and objects in their nearby environment or habitat, creating
local wireless mesh networks.
Thus was the mesh born, taking the place of the old internet of earth,
lost during the Fall.
