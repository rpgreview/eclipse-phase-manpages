⊳ Desdemona: Glad to have you back.
I hope you had a pleasant farcast from Pelion and don't feel too much
lack.
While you were out, a message from Aeneas with a precis on psi,
extracted from the infomorph backup of psigeneticist Daborva (StellInt,
Dipole Research Station on Ganymede), was rerouted for distribution to
your Firewall node.
.RE
.PP
Coined by the biologist Bertold P.
Wiesner, \[lq]psi\[rq] was originally an umbrella term used to describe
a number of so\-called \[lq]psychic\[rq] abilities and other speculative
paranormal phenomena such as telepathy and extra\-sensory perception.
While the term was used extensively in the field of parapsychology and
pop culture in the twentieth and early twenty\-first centuries, the
study of psi was largely considered a pseudoscience with flawed
methodologies and gradually lost funding and support.
During the Fall, however, repeated rumors and accounts of unexplained
phenomenon drew the attention of scientists, military leaders, and
singularity seekers alike.
Numerous nanovirii had been unleashed upon transhumanity, racing through
populations and transforming as they spread.
Some inflicted only minor biological or mental changes and impairments,
but many were vicious and deadly.
The most feared variants, however, were those that Firewall has come to
label as the Exsurgent virus\[em]a transformative nano\-plague that
mutates its victims and subverts them to its will.
The Exsurgent virus was also observed to radically modify the subject's
neural patterns and mental state, affecting synaptic arrangement and
even modulating synaptic currents.
These changes alter and enhance the victim's cognition and seemed to
endow an ability to sense and even affect the minds of others from a
short distance\[em]an ability dubbed \[lq]psi\[rq] as the causal factors
continue to mystify us.
The existence and nature of this phenomenon remains carefully concealed
and under wraps in controlled habitats, so as not to trigger widespread
panic.
Among anarchist and other open communities, knowledge of psi is more
widespread, but details are vague and reports are generally greeted with
skepticism.
The Exsurgent virus is exceptionally mutable and adaptive, however, and
two argonaut researchers who were aware of and studying it soon made an
interesting discovery.
One variant strain of the virus was found that endowed the subject with
exceptional mental abilities without engaging the transformative process
of the other strains.
Though infection still has other drawbacks, Firewall and other agencies
have come to regard this strain as \[lq]safe\[rq] in the sense that the
subject does not transmogrify into something else and their general
personality remains intact.
Intrigued that this avenue of inquiry might lead to a way to nullify the
effects of other Exsurgent strains, Firewall and others continue to
experiment with the strain with the cooperation of willing test subjects
(or according to some reports, unwilling victims in the case of certain
authorities and hypercorps).
.SS THE NATURE OF PSI
.PP
Labeled the Watts\-MacLeod strain after the researchers who isolated it,
further study has gained insight into the effect this virus has on
transhuman brains.
Careful analysis of infected subjects discovered that their altered
synapses generate a modulated brainwave pattern that is extremely
difficult to detect.
Those \[lq]in\-the\-know\[rq] have come to refer to these asynchronous
brainwaves as \[lq]psi waves,\[rq] fitting with the Greek letter
designation of other brainwaves (alpha, beta, delta, gamma, theta).
Likewise, affected individuals are known as \[lq]asyncs.\[rq]
Exploration of the explicit causal factors behind psi waves remains
stymied.
Theories regarding extraordinary mental processes with the ability to
change quantum states have been explored but remain frustratingly
inconclusive.
Neuroimaging and mapping have enabled scientists to pinpoint structures
within the brain, neural activity, and perturbations in the brain's
bioelectric field that are associated with psi processes, but attempts
to duplicate these features in non\-infected brains have resulted in
failure or worse.
Attempts to identify asyncs by psi brainwave patterns are not even
assured of success.
Numerous dead ends have prompted many researchers to postulate that the
mechanics underlying psi are simply too strange and too far beyond
transhumanity's understanding of physical sciences\[em]perhaps
reinforcing theories that the Exsurgent virus is in fact of alien
origin.
One leading speculation is that the changes wrought in the mind by
infection actually entangle some of the neural sub\-systems, enable some
sort of quantum field within the brain, or possibly create
Bose\-Einstein condensates within the brain, allowing for quantum
computation or perhaps hypercomputation.
This enhances the async's mental capabilities to the level provided by
modern implants and neuro\-mods\[em]and sometimes beyond.
This does not explain the capabilities of other asyncs, however,
especially those used to read or affect other biological minds.
These abilities seem to involve reading brain waves from a short range
or affecting another's mind via direct physical contact with the
target's bio\-electric fields.
Of course I can only speculate in accordance with what Firewall has
uncovered\[em]it is quite possible that certain hypercorps or other
factions have made further breakthroughs, but are keeping the
information to themselves.
The initiation and use of psi talents is generally understood to take
place on a subconscious level, meaning that the async is not actively
aware of the fundamental processes that fuel the psi\-waves.
Training in certain skills, however, allows an async to focus on certain
tasks and psi abilities.
These are called \[lq]sleights:\[rq] mnemonic or cognitive algorithms of
psi use rooted in the async's ego.
The percentage of the transhuman population believed to have contracted
the Watts\-MacLeod strain remains statistically insignificant\[em]less
than .001% of the population.
The vast number of asyncs have been recruited by various agencies,
\[lq]disappeared\[rq] for study, or simply eliminated as a potential
threat.
Ten years after the Fall, Firewall and other agencies have come to
regard Watts\-MacLeod infection as comparatively safe, though we remain
quite wary of unforeseen side effects or other hidden dangers.
Most of us engaged in studying the phenomenon now consider asyncs to be
useful as a tool for fighting the Exsurgent virus and other
threatsdespite the protests of those who are convinced that asyncs are
not in control of their own minds and are not to be trusted.
As of yet we have encountered no cases of Watts\-MacLeod infection that
have inflicted anything other than psi abilities, though there seems to
be an increased risk for asyncs to succumb to other Exsurgent strains
should they encounter them.
There are other risks associated with Watts\-MacLeod infection, such as
extreme fatigue and even lethal biofeedback resulting from extensive use
of psi sleights and a statistically likelihood of developing mental
disorders due to the increased mental stress placed on the async's mind.

\f[B]\f[BI]1\f[B]\f[] Sorry to bother you, but my muse just alerted me
to this excerpt that was sent around to my Firewall team.
Is this for real?
I've heard the talk about psi before\[em]enough to be convinced that
there's something to it, even if we can't explain it\[em]but this bit
about variant Exsurgent infection is too much.
Are we seriously going to be working with someone who's a known carrier?
And can you shed any more light on how asyncs do their mojo?
I'm worried now.
And since you are connected to the Medeans, I thought I'd take the
chance and ask.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] Well, as to the Medeans ...
that's history.
I am back on the freelancing market right now.
But no problem, I'll try and explain.
I know it is not easy to grasp.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]1\f[B]\f[] Shiny.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] Yes, Srit was once infected with a strain of the
Exsurgent virus, probably on Mars near the end of the Fall.
I say \[lq]was\[rq] because the Watts\-MacLeod strain seems to go
dormant shortly after it finishes rewiring the victim's brain; the
plague nanobots die off and get flushed out of the system, unlike other
Exsurgent strains, which continue to stick around and transform the
subject.
At least, that's the dominant theory\[em]I've also seen some speculation
that async minds might be modified so that they continue to produce
bio\-nanobots that linger in the brain, though what function these serve
remains unclear.
However, the prevailing opinion among our best neuroscientists is that
people like Srit are safe and non\-infectious once the virus has run its
course.
I'll even go a bit further and say that prevailing opinion is that they
can be trusted, assuming they don't catch another infection ...
which they unfortunately seem to be a bit prone too.
Not everyone agrees of course, but we have an abundance of paranoia in
our circles.
So far, we haven't seen any evidence that any of our asyncs have been
turned by that initial infection, and the utility and usefulness of
having psiactives on our side has simply been too important to push
aside.
All right.
I can't say that I'll trust her, but I'll try and give her the benefit
of the doubt.
I'll be damned if I'm going to trust an async that's not vouched for by
Firewall though\[em]who knows what the hell a hypercorp like Skinthetic
might be cooking up in their black labs.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] That seems like a wise choice.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]1\f[B]\f[] Maybe you can put my mind at ease by explaining to
me in a bit more detail how Watts\-MacLeod infection occurs.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] Well, like the other Exsurgent strains you are
unfortunately familiar with, the primary transmission vector is a
nanovirus, but we speculate that it may also be transmitted as a digital
computer virus or possibly even as a basilisk hack.
The physical plague form is spread by highly\-advanced techno\-organic
nanobots that infect a biomorph and use bio\-mimicry mechanisms to pass
as normal cells and penetrate the blood\-brain barrier and central
nervous system.
The nanobots are several steps beyond anything our technology can
produce, are very difficult to detect, and can overwhelm most defensive
countermeasures.
Infected minds are essentially rewired, and these changes will be copied
when the ego is uploaded.
Synthmorphs and infomorphs remain immune to this nano\-infection, but
they are theoretically vulnerable to other transmission vectors.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]1\f[B]\f[] I've heard that synthmorphs are effectively
invulnerable to psi as well.
This true?
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] Yes.
As far as we can tell, async abilities only effect biological
minds\[em]either their own or others.
And they can only read/affect others from a very short distance,
requiring physical contact in most cases.
The half\-biological minds of pods are also vulnerable, though to a
lesser extent.
Likewise, asyncs need a biological brain to use their abilities\[em]they
can't use their psi if sleeved in a synthmorph and have difficulty in a
pod.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]1\f[B]\f[] Interesting.
So, I have to ask again\[em] you're sure she's safe?
I've heard that some of these asyncs can be real nut\-jobs.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] I've heard from several of these asyncs directly.
The fact is, infection rewrites their brain, and some of them came out
the other side feeling fundamentally altered.
Either they felt like a different person, or they felt like there was
something new that was part of them\[em]something that they didn't
necessarily like.
One described it as presence, another as a black void that whispered at
them.
Yet another described it as giving a personality to their unconscious
mind, which only made the gulf between unconscious and conscious mind
all the more intimidating.
Some of them preferred to suicide and revert to a pre\-infection backup.
While they may be more prone to cracking up as a result, I haven't ever
heard one talk about their abilities as something they couldn't control.
.PP
1 Well, that's fucking cheery.
There's nothing else we have on how this psi stuff actually works?
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] Unfortunately, we don't.
Even the Prometheans haven't been much help.
There are theories, of course, but nothing that we've been able to
verify with rigorous experimentation.
It doesn't help that the factions that are aware of psi's existence
don't exactly compare notes\[em]they're all too busy looking into ways
to weaponize it and use it against each other, instead of figuring out
how to use it for the benefit of transhumanity.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]1\f[B]\f[] Of course.
The TITANs didn't get us, but we can still get ourselves.
It worries me that the best we've come up with is nothing.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]2\f[B]\f[] It's important to keep perspective.
Transhumanity has come quite a distance and made some impressive
accomplishments, but our understanding of the universe is still in its
infancy.
What we may be facing here is something concocted by an intelligence so
far beyond our own that we are but insignificant insects in comparison.
It likely has a grasp on the universe that is simply beyond our ability
to understand.
We shouldn't be cocky and think that we can decipher any mystery thrown
at us ...
we should instead be very, very afraid.
.PP
Though neuroscience has ascended to impressive pinnacles, allowing minds
to be thoroughly scanned, mapped, and emulated as software, the
transhuman brain remains a place that is complicated, not fully
understood, and thoroughly messy.
Despite a prevalence of neural modifications, meddling with the seat of
consciousness remains a tricky and hazardous procedure.
Nevertheless, psychosurgery\[em]editing the mind as software\[em]remains
common and widespread, sometimes with unexpected results.
Likewise, even as the knowledge of neuroscientists grows on an
exponential basis, some are discovering that minds are far more
mysterious than they had ever imagined.
During the Fall, scattered reports of \[lq]anomalous activity\[rq] by
individuals infected by one of the numerous circulating nanoplagues were
discounted as fear and paranoia, but subsequent investigations by black
budget labs has proven otherwise.
Now, toplevel confidential networks whisper that this infection inflicts
intricate changes in the victim's neural network that imbue them with
strange and inexplicable abilities.
The exact mechanism and nature of these abilities remains unexplained
and outside the grasp of modern transhuman science.
Given the evidence of a new brainwave type and the paranormal nature of
this phenomenon, it is loosely referred to as \[lq]psi.\[rq]
.SS PSI
.PP
In Eclipse Phase, psi is considered a special cognitive condition
resulting from infection by the mutant\[em]and hopefully otherwise
benign\[em]Watts\-Macleod strain of the Exsurgent virus (p.
367).
This plague modifies the victim's mind, conferring special abilities.
These abilities are inherent to the brain's architecture and are copied
when the mind is uploaded, allowing the character to retain their psi
abilities when changing from morph to morph.
.SS PREREQUISITES
.PP
To wield psi, a character must acquire the Psi trait (p.
147) during character creation.
It is theoretically also possible to acquire the use of psi in game via
infection by the Watts\-MacLeod strain; see The Exsurgent Virus, p.
362.
Psi ability is considered an innate ability of the ego and not a
biological or genetic predisposition of the morph.
While psi researchers do not understand how it is possible to transfer
this ability via uploads, backups, and farcasting, it has been
speculated that all components of an async's ego are entangled on a
quantum level, or that they possess the ability to entangle themselves
or form a unique conformation or alignment as a whole even after they
have been copied, up\-, or downloaded.
This speculated entanglement process is also thought to be the origin of
the impairment that asyncs experience when adapting to a new morph (see
below).
.SS MORPHS AND PSI
.PP
Asyncs require a biological brain to draw on their abilities (the brains
of uplifted animals count).
An async whose ego is downloaded into an infomorph or fully computerized
brain (synthmorphs) has no access to their abilities as long they remain
in that morph.
Asyncs inhabiting a pod morph may use psi, but their abilities are
restricted as pod brains are only partly biological.
Pod\-morphed asyncs suffer a \[en]30 modifier on all tests involving the
use of psi sleights and the impact from using sleights would be doubled.
.SS MORPH ACCLIMATIZATION
.PP
Async minds undergo extra difficulty adjusting to new morphs.
For 1 day after the character has resleeved, they will suffer the
effects of a single derangement (p.
210).
The gamemaster and player should choose a derangement appropriate to the
character and story.
Minor derangements are recommended, but at the gamemaster's discretion
moderate or major derangements may be applied.
No trauma is inflicted with this derangement.
.SS MORPH FEVER
.PP
Asyncs find it irritating and traumatizing to endure life as an
infomorph, pod, or synthmorph for long periods of time.
This phenomenon, known as morph fever, might cause temporary
derangements and trauma to the asyncs' ego, possibly even to the grade
of permanent disorders.
If stored or held captive as an active infomorph (i.e.
not in virtual stasis), the async might go insane if not psychologically
aided by some sort of anodyne program or supporting person during
storage.
In game terms, asyncs take 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) points of mental stress
damage per month they stay in a pod, synthmorph or infomorph form
without psychological assistance by a psychiatrist, software, or muse.
.SS PSI DRAWBACKS
.PP
There are several drawbacks to psi ability:
.IP \[bu] 2
The variant Exsurgent strain that endows psi ability rewires the
character's brain.
An unfortunate side effect to this change is that asyncs acquire a
vulnerability to mental stress.
Reduce the async's Trauma Threshold by 1.
.IP \[bu] 2
The mental instability that accompanies psi infection also tends to
unhinge the character's mind.
Asyncs acquires one Mental Disorder negative trait (p.
150) for each level they have of the Psi trait without receiving any
bonus CP.
The gamemaster and player should agree on a disorder appropriate to the
character.
This disorder may be treated over time, according to normal rules (see
Mental Healing and Psychotherapy, p.
215).
.IP \[bu] 2
Characters with the Psi trait are also vulnerable to infection by other
strains of the Exsurgent virus.
The character suffers a \[en]20 modifier when resisting Exsurgent
infection (p.
362).
.IP \[bu] 2
Critical failures when using psi tend to stress the async's mind.
Each time a critical failure is rolled when making a sleight\-related
test, the async suffers a temporary brain seizure.
They suffer a \[en]30 modifi er and are incapable of acting until the
end of the next Action Turn.
They must also succeed in a WIL + COG Test or fall down.
.SS PSI SKILLS AND SLEIGHTS
.PP
Transhuman psi users can manipulate their egos and otherwise create
effects that can often be neither matched nor mimicked by technological
means.
To use these abilities, they train their mental processes and practice
cognitive algorithms called sleights, which they can subconsciously
recall and use as necessary.
Sleights fall into two categories: psi\-chi (cognitive enhancements, p.
223) and psi\-gamma (brainwave reading and manipulation, p.
225).
Psi\-chi sleights are available to anyone with the Psi trait (p.
147), but psigamma sleights are only available to characters with the
Psi trait at Level 2.
In order to use these sleights, the async must be skilled in the Control
(p.
178), Psi Assault (p.
183), and/or Sense skills (p.
184), as appropriate to each sleight.
.SS ROLEPLAYING ASYNCS
.PP
Any player who chooses to play an async should keep the origin of their
abilities in mind: Watts\-MacLeod strain infection.
The character may not be aware of this source, but they undoubtedly know
that they underwent some sort of transformation and have talents that no
one else does.
If unaware of the infection, they have likely learned to keep their
abilities secret lest they be ridiculed, attacked, or whisked away to
some secret testing program.
Learning the truth about their nature could even be the starting point
of a campaign and/or their introduction to Firewall.
If they know the truth, however, the character must live with the fact
that they are the victim of a nanoplague likely spread by the TITANs
that may or may not lead to complications, side effects, or other
unexpected revelations in their future.
Gamemasters and players should make an effort to explore the nature of
this infection and how the character perceives it.
As noted previously, asyncs are often profoundly\-changed people.
The invasive and alien aspect of their abilities should not be lost on
them.
For example, an async might conceive of their psi talents as a sort of
parasitic entity, living off their sleights, or they might feel that
using these powers puts them in touch with some sort of fundamental
substrate of the universe that is weird and terrifying.
Alternately, they could feel as if their personality was melded with
something different, something that doesn't belong.
Each async is likely to view their situation differently, and none of
them pleasantly.
.SS USING PSI
.PP
Using psi\[em]i.e., drawing on a certain sleight to procure some kind of
effect\[em]does not always require a test.
Each sleight description details how the power is used.
.SS ACTIVE PSI
.PP
Active psi sleights must be \[lq]activated\[rq] to be used.
These sleights usually require a skill test.
Sleights that target other sentient beings or life forms are always
Opposed Tests, while others are handled as Success Tests.
The level of concentration required to use these sleights varies, and so
may call for a Quick, Complex, or Task Action.
Active sleights also cause strain (p.
223) to the async.
Most psi\-gamma sleights fall into this category.
.SS PASSIVE PSI
.PP
Passive psi sleights encompasses abilities that are considered
automatically active and subconscious.
They rarely require an action to be activated and require no effort or
strain by the psi user.
Passive sleights typically add bonuses to various activities or allow
access to certain abilities rather than calling for some kind of skill
test.
Most psi\-chi sleights fall into this category.
.SS PSI RANGE
.PP
Sleights have a Range of either Self, Touch, or Close.
Self: These sleights only affect the async.
Touch: Sleights with a Touch range may be used against other biological
life, but the async must have physical contact with the target.
If the target avoids being touched, this requires a successful melee
attack, applying the touch\-only +20 modifier.
This attack does not cause damage, and is considered part of the same
action as the psi use.
Close: Close sleights involve interaction with other biological life
from a short distance.
The optimal distance is within 5 meters.
For each meter beyond that, apply a \[en]10 modifier to the test.
Psi vs.
Psi: Due to the nature of psi, sleights are more effective against other
psi users.
Sleights with a range of Touch may be used from a Close range against
another async.
Likewise, a sleight with a Close range may be used at twice the normal
distance (10 meters) when wielded on another async.
.SS TARGETING
.PP
Synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles may not be targeted by psi sleights, as
they lack biological brains.
Pods \- with brains that are half biological and half computer \- are
less susceptible and receive a +30 modifier when defending against psi
use.
Note that infomorphs may never be targeted by psi sleights as psi is not
effective within the mesh or simulspace.
Multiple Targets: An async may target more than one character with a
sleight with the same action, as long as each of them can be targeted
via the rules above.
The psi character only rolls once, with each of the defending characters
making their Opposed Tests against that roll.
The psi character suffers strain (p.
223) for each target, however, meaning that using psi on multiple
targets can be extremely dangerous.
Animals and Less Complex Life Forms: Psi works against any living
creature with a brain and/or nervous system.
Against partially\-sentient and partially\- uplifted animals, it suffers
a \[en]20 modifier and increases strain by +1.
Against non\-sentient animals, it suffers a \[en]30 modifier and
increases strain by +3.
It has no effect on or against less complex life forms like plants,
algae, bacteria, etc.
Factors and Aliens: At the gamemaster's discretion, psi sleights may not
work on alien creatures at all, depending on their physiology and
neurology.
If it does work, it is likely to suffer at least a \[en]20 modifier and
+1 strain.
.SS OPPOSED TESTS
.PP
Psi that is used against another character is resisted with an Opposed
Test.
Defending characters resist with WIL x 2.
Willing characters may choose not to resist.
Unconscious or sleeping characters cannot resist.
If the psi\-wielding character succeeds and the defender fails, the
sleight affects the target.
If the psi user fails, the defender is unscathed.
If both parties succeed in their tests, compare their dice rolls.
If the psi user's roll is higher, the sleight bypasses the defender's
mental block and affects the target; otherwise, the sleight fails to
affect the defender's ego.
.SS TARGET AWARENESS
.PP
The target of a psi sleight is aware they are being targeted any time
they succeed on their half of the Opposed Test (regardless on whether
the async rolls higher or not).
Note that awareness does not necessarily mean that the target
understands that psi abilities are being used on them, especially as
most people in Eclipse Phase are unaware of psi's existence.
Instead, the target is simply likely to understand that some outside
influence is at work, or that something strange is happening.
They may suspect that they have been drugged or are under the influence
of some strange technology.
Targets who fail their roll remain unaware.
.SS PSI FULL DEFENSE
.PP
Like full defense in physical combat (p.
198), a defender may spend a Complex Action to rally and concentrate
their mental defenses, gaining a +30 modifier to their defense test
against psi use until their next Action Phase.
.SS CRITICALS
.PP
If the defender rolls a critical success, the character attempting to
wield psi is temporarily locked out of the target's mind.
The psi user may not target that character with sleights until an
appropriate \[lq]reset\[rq] period has passed, determined by the
gamemaster.
If the async rolls a critical failure, they suffer temporary
incapacitation as their mind dysfunctions in some harsh and distressing
ways (see Psi Drawbacks, p.
221).
If a psi user rolls a critical success against a defender, or the
defender rolls a critical failure, double the potency of the sleight's
effect.
In the case of psi attacks, the DV can be doubled or mental armor can be
bypassed.
Alternately, when using Psi Assault (p.
183), the targeted character may be in danger of infection by the
Watts\-Macleod strain (p.
362).
.SS MENTAL ARMOR
.PP
The Psi Shield sleight (p.
228) provides mental armor, a form of neural hardening against
psi\-based attacks.
Like physical armor, this mental armor reduces the amount of damage
inflicted by a psi assault.
.SS DURATION
.PP
Psi sleights have one of four durations: constant, instant, temporary,
or sustained.
Constant: Constant sleights are always \[lq]on.\[rq] Instant: Instant
sleights take effect only in the Action Phase in which they are used.
Temporary: Temporary sleights last for a limited duration with no extra
effort from the async.
The temporary duration is determined by the async's WIL ÷ 5 (round up)
and is measured in either Action Turns or minutes, as noted.
Strain for the sleight is applied immediately when used, not at the end
of the duration.
Sustained: Sustained sleights require active effort to maintain for as
long as the async wants to keep it active.
Sustaining a sleight requires concentration, and so the async suffers a
\[en]10 modifier to all other skill tests while the sleight is
sustained.
The async must also stay within the range appropriate to the sleight,
otherwise the sleight immediately ends.
More than one sleight may be sustained at a time, with a cumulative
modifier.
Strain for the sleight is applied immediately when used, not at the end
of the duration.
At the gamemaster's discretion, sleights that are sustained for long
periods may incur additional strain.
.SS STRAIN
.PP
The use of psi is physically (and sometimes psychologically) draining to
a psi user.
This phenomenon is known as strain, and manifests as fatigue,
exhaustion, pain, neural overload, cardiovascular stress, and adynamia
(loss of vigor).
Though strain has only rarely been known to actually kill an async, the
use of too much active psi can be life\-threatening in some
circumstances.
In game terms, every active sleight has a Strain Value of 1d10 ÷ 2
(round up) DV.
Every active sleight lists a Strain Value Modifier that modifies this
amount.
For example, a sleights with a Strain Value Modifier of \[en]1 inflicts
(1d10 ÷ 2) \[en]1 DV.
If the damage points suffered from strain exceed the character's Wound
Threshold, they may inflict a wound just like other damage (see Wounds,
p.
207).

\f[B]EXAMPLE\f[]

.PD
Matric is investigating a disappearance, so he decides to use his Qualia
sleight to boost his Intuition while hunting for clues.
That psi\-chi sleight takes only a Quick Action to initiate and requires
no test.
Matric's WIL is 25, so the duration of this temporary sleight is 5
Action Turns (25 ÷ 5 = 5).
The sleight's Strain modifier is \[en]1, so he is facing (1d10 ÷ 2)
\[en]1 DV.
He rolls a 1, so he takes no strain at all! Later on, Matric finds
himself in a life\-or\-death struggle with a kidnapper.
Lucky for Matric, they're in a melee, so he's close enough to try and
touch his opponent.
On his Action Phase, he makes an Unarmed Combat Test with a +20 modifi
er (for a touch\-only attack) and succeeds.
This allows him to try and use his Psychic Stab sleight.
He rolls his Psi Assault of 57 against the target's WIL x 2 (32).
His target is in a worker pod morph, however, which is less susceptible
to psi, so he receives a +30 modifier (32 + 30 = 62).
Matric rolls a 32 and the worker pod a 64\[em]Matric wins! For damage,
he rolls 1d10 + (WIL ÷ 10).
His WIL is 25, so that's 1d10 + 3.
He rolls a score a 7 and inflicts 10 (7 + 3) points of damage.
The worker pod screams in pain, suffering a wound from the psychic
assault.

This sleight provides the async with the ability to send the mind into a
fugue\-state regenerative downtime, during which the character's psyche
is repaired.
The async must enter the downtime for at least 4 hours; every 4 hours of
downtime heals 1 point of stress damage.
Traumas, derangements, and disorders are unaffected by this sleight.
For all sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during downtime,
completely oblivious to the outside world.
Only severe disturbances or physical shock (such as being wounded or hit
by a shock weapon) will bring the async out of it.

at and handling it.
If the character succeeds in a COG x 2 Test, they achieve a basic
ability to use the object, vehicle, or device, no matter how alien or
bizarre.
This sleight does not provide any understanding of the principles or
technologies involved\[em]the psi user simply grasps how to make it
work.
If a test is called for, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the
device (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices, and/or tests the

The character is adept at spotting patterns and correlating the
non\-random elements of a jumble\[em]related items jump out at them.
This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or find clues
hidden among massive amounts of data.
The character must have a sufficiently large sample enough time to
study, as determined by the gamemaster.
This might range from a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman
language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long\-dead
aliens to a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher.
Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them being
spoken.
Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation,
Research, or cod\-breaking Tests (note that this does not apply to
Infosec Tests made by software to decrypt a code).
The async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages,
reducing the training time by half.

The Bayesian probability machine features of the async's brain are
boosted by this sleight, enhancing their ability to estimate and predict
outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real\-time and update
those predictions as information changes.
In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes
are most likely.
This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve
predicting the outcome of events.
It also bolsters the async's decision\-making in combat situations by
making the best course of action more clear, and so provides a +10 bonus
to both Initiative and Fray Tests.

The character possesses an incredible facility with intuitive
mathematics.
They can do everything from calculate the odds exactly when gambling to
predicting precisely where a leaf falling from a tree will land by
observing the landscape and local wind currents.
The character specializes in calculation involving the activity of
complex chaotic systems and so can calculate answers that even the
fastest computers could not, including things like patterns of rubble
distribution from an explosion.
However, this mathematic facility is largely intuitive, so the character
does not know the equations they are solving, they merely know the
solution to the problem.

This sleight allows the async to override their consciousness and let
their unconscious mind take point.
While in this state, the async's conscious mind is only dimly aware of
what is transgressing, and any memories of this period will be hazy at
best.
The advantage is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and so the
async's Speed is boosted by +1.
The character remains aware and active, but is incapable of complex
communication or other mental actions and is motivated by instinct and
primitive urges more than conscious thought.
Though it is recommended that the player retain control of their
character while using Unconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free
to direct the character's actions as they see fit.
.SS PSI\-GAMMA SLEIGHTS

For every 10 full points of MoS the async achieves on their test, they
retrieve one piece of information.
Each item takes one full Action Turn to retrieve, during which the

Ego Sense can be used to detect the presence and location of other

To detect these life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, opposed
by each life form within range.
The async may suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and insects,
similar to the modifier applied for targeting them in ranged combat (see
p.
193); likewise, a modifier for detecting larger life forms may also be
applied.
If successful, the async has detected that the life form is nearby.
Every 10 full points of MoS will ascertain another piece of information

type of creature, distance from async, etc.
The async will know if the target moves, if they do so during the

An async using this sleight can implant a memory of up to an hour's

This memory very obviously does not belong to the target\[em]there is no
way they will confuse it for one of their own.
The intent is not to fake memories, but to place one of the async's
memories in the target's mind so that the target can access it just like
any other memory.
This can be useful for \[lq]archiving\[rq] important data with an ally,
providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a \[lq]data

An async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to other biological life

opposed by any life that has focused their attention on them within the
sleight's range; if successful, the async knows they are being watched,
but not by whom or what.
It does, however, apply a +30 Perception bonus to spot the observer.
This sleight does not register partial attention or fleeting attention,

Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with any offensive
sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill.
It allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an opponent by
concentrating their psi attack.
Every point of Armor Penetration applied to a psi attack inflicts 1
point of strain.
The maximum AP that may be applied equals the async's Psi Assault skill
divided by 10 (round down).

The Subliminal sleight allows the async to influence the train of
thought of another person by implementing a single post\-hypnotic
suggestion into the mind of the target.
If the async wins the Opposed Test, the recipient will carry out this
suggestion as if it was their own idea.
Implanted suggestions must be short and simple; as a rule of thumb, the
gamemaster may only suggestions encompassed by a short sentence (for
example: \[lq]open the airlock,\[rq] or \[lq]hand over the weapon\[rq]).
At the gamemaster's discretion, the target may receive a bonus for
resisting suggestions that are immediately life threatening (\[lq]jump
off the bridge\[rq]) or that violate their motivations or personal
strictures.
Suggestions do not need to be carried out immediately, they may be
implanted with a short trigger condition (\[lq]when the alarm goes off,

Rather than digging through the target's ego as with the Deep Scan
sleight, Thought Browse merely verifies whether a target has a

a savvy investigator to draw conclusions without the need to invade the
mind directly.
Thought Browse may be sustained, allowing the async to continue scanning
the target's thoughts over time.
The async must beat the target in an Opposed Test for each scanned item.
.SS PSYCHOSURGERY
.PP
Given the reach of neuroscience in the time of Eclipse Phase, it is easy
to think of the mind as programmable software, as something that can be
reverse\-engineered, re\-coded, upgraded, and patched.
To a large degree, this is true.
Aided by nanotechnology, genetics, and cognitive science,
neuroscientists have demolished numerous barriers to understanding the
mind's structure and functions, and even made great leaps in unveiling
the true nature of consciousness.
Genetic tweaks, neuro\-mods, and neural implants offer an assortment of
options for improving the brain's capabilities.
The transhuman mind has become a playground\[em]and a battlefield.
Nanovirii unleashed during the Fall infected millions, altering their
brains in permanent ways, with occasional outbreaks still occurring a
decade later.
Cognitive virii roam the mesh, plaguing infomorphs and AIs,
reprogramming mind states.
An \[lq]infectious idea\[rq] is now a literal term.
In truth, mind editing is not an easy, safe, and error\-proof
process\[em]it is difficult, dangerous, and often flawed.
Neuroscience may be light years ahead of where it was a century ago, but
there are many aspects of the brain and neural functions that continue
to confound and elude even the brightest experts and AIs.
Technologies like nanoneural mapping, uploading, digital mind emulation,
and artificial intelligence are also comparatively in their infancy,
being mere decades old.
Though transhumanity has a handle on how to make these processes work,
it does not always fully understand the underlying mechanisms.
Any neurotech will tell you that mucking around in the mind's muddy
depths is a messy business.
Brains are organic devices, molded by millions of years of unplanned
evolutionary development.
Each is grown haphazardly, loaded with evolutionary leftovers, and
randomly modified by an unlimited array of life events and environmental
factors.
Every mind features numerous mechanisms\[em]cells, connections,
receptors\[em]that handle a dizzying array of functions: memory,
perception, learning, reasoning, emotion, instinct, consciousness, and
more.
Its system of organization and storage is holonomic, diffused, and
disorganized.
Even the geneticallymodifi ed and enhanced brains of transhumans are
crowded, chaotic, cross\-wired places, with each mind storing its
memories, personality, and other defining features in unique ways.
What this means is that though the general architecture and topography
of neural networks can be scanned and deduced, the devil is in the
details.
Techniques used to modify, repair, or enhance one person's mind are not
guaranteed equal success when applied to another's brain.
For example, the process by which brains store knowledge, skills, and
memories results in a strange chaining process where these memories are
linked and associated with other memories, so attempts to alter one
memory can have adverse affects on other memories.
In the end, minds are slippery and dodgy things, and attempts to reshape
them rarely go as planned.
.SS THE PROCESS OF PSYCHOSURGERY
.PP
Psychosurgery is the process of selective, surgical alteration of a
transhuman mind.
It is a separate field from neural genetic modification (which alters
genetic code), neuralware implantation (adding cybernetic or biotech
inserts to the brain or nervous system), or brain hacking (software
attacks on computer brains, neural inserts, and infomorphs), though they
are sometimes combined.
Psychosurgery is almost always performed on a digital mind\-state,
whether that be a real\-time emulation, a backup, or a fork.
In most cases, the subject's mind\-state is copied via the same
technology and process as uploading or forking, and run in a simulspace.
The subject need not be willing, and in these cases the subject's
permissions are restricted.
Numerous psychosurgery simulspace environments are available, each
custom\-designed for facilitating specific psychosurgical goals and
programmed with a thorough selection of psychotherapy treatment options.
The actual process of psychosurgery breaks down into several stages.
First is diagnosis, which can involve the use of several neuro\-imaging
techniques on morphed characters, mapping synaptic connections, and
building a neurochemical model.
It can also involve complete psychological profiling and psychometric
behavioral testing, including personality tests and simulspace scenario
simulations.
Digital mind\-states can be compared to records of people with similar
symptoms in order to identify related information clusters.
This analysis is used to plan the procedure.
The actual implementation of psychosurgical alteration can involve
several methods, depending on the desired results.
Applying external modules to the mind\-state is often the best approach,
as it doesn't meddle with complicated connections and new inputs are
readily interpreted and assimilated.
For treatments, mental health software patches compiled from databases
of healthy minds are matched, customized, and applied.
Specialized programs may be run to stimulate certain mental processes
for therapeutic purposes.
Before an alteration is even applied, it may first be performed on a
fork of the subject and run at accelerated speeds to evaluate the
outcome.
Likewise, multiple treatment choices may be applied to time\-accelerated
forks this way, allowing the psychosurgeon to test which is likely to
work best.
Not all psychosurgery is performed for the subject's benefit, of course.
Psychosurgery can be used to interrogate or torture prisoners, erase
memories, modify behavior, or inflict crippling impairments.
It is also sometimes used for legal punishment purposes, in an attempt
to impair criminal activity.
Needless to say, such methods are often brute\-forced rather than
fine\-tuned, ignoring safety parameters and sometimes resulting in
detrimental side effects.

The Human Cognome Project was an academic research venture to reverse
engineer the human brain, paralleling in many ways the Human Genome
Project and its success in deciphering the human genome.
The HCP was a multidisciplinary undertaking, relevant to biology,
neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence,
and philosophy of mind.
Funded and supported by scientific and corporate entrepreneurs and early
transhumanist groups, the HCP developed the fundamentals of digitizing
an ego and was a major driving force towards the first transhumans with
elevated intelligence and brain capacity.
The HCP has also been instrumental in cataloging transhuman minds and
developing databases of \[lq]mind patches\[rq] based on the mind\-states
of healthy individuals for treating mental diseases and damage.
Though most HCP data is available to the public, some argonauts claim
that certain data is held hostage by some hypercorps, potentially for
the development of proprietary mind\-altering technologies.
After the Fall, the remnants of this project were acquired by the
Planetary Consortium.
.RE
.SS PSYCHOSURGERY MECHANICS
.PP
In game terms, psychosurgery is handled as a Task Action requiring an
Opposed Test.
The psychosurgeon rolls Psychosurgery skill against the target's WIL x
3.
Apply modifiers as appropriate from the Psychosurgery Modifiers table.
If the psychosurgeon succeeds and the subject fails, the psychosurgery
is effective and permanent.
The alteration becomes a permanent part of the subject's ego, and will
be copied when uploaded (and sometimes when forking).
If both sides succeed but the psychosurgeon rolls higher, the
psychosurgery is effective but temporary.
It lasts for 1 week per 10 points of MoS.
If the subject rolls higher, or if the psychosurgeon fails their roll,
the attempt does not work.
The timeframe listed for psychosurgical procedures is according to the
patient's subjective point of view.
Since most subjects are treated in a simulspace, time acceleration may
drastically reduce the amount of real\-time such a procedure requires
(see Defying Nature's Laws, pp.
240\[en]241).
.SS MENTAL STRESS
.PP
Psychosurgery is a modification to the transhuman mind, and sometimes to
the actual person that resides in that mind.
It is unsurprising then that psychosurgery places stress on the
subject's mental state and sometimes even inflicts mental traumas.
Each psychosurgery option lists a Stress Value (SV) that is inflicted on
the subject regardless of the tests' success or failure.
If the psychosurgeon achieves an Excellent Success (MoS 30+), this
stress is halved (round down).
If the psychosurgeon rolls a Severe Failure (MoF 30+), the stress is
doubled.
Alternately, a Severe Failure could result in unintended side effects,
such as affecting other behaviors, emotions, or memories.
If a critical success is rolled, no stress is applied at all.
If a critical failure is rolled, however, an automatic trauma is applied
in addition to the normal stress.
Some psychosurgery conditions may also affect the SV, as noted on the
Psychosurgery Modifiers table.
.SS ROLEPLAYING MIND EDITS
.PP
Many of the changes incurred by psychosurgery are nebulous and difficult
to pin down with game mechanics.
Alterations to a character's personality and mind\-state are often
better handled as roleplaying factors anyway.
This means that players should make a real effort to integrate any such
mental modifications into their character's words and actions, and
gamemasters should ensure that a character's portrayal plays true to
their mind edits.
Some psychosurgical mods can be reflected with ego traits, while others
might incur modifiers to certain tests or in certain situations.
The gamemaster should carefully weigh a brain alteration's effects, and
apply modifiers as they see appropriate.
.SS PSYCHOSURGERY PROCEDURES
.PP
The following alterations may be accomplished with psychosurgery.
At the gamemaster's discretion, other mind\-editing procedures may be
attempted, using these as a guideline.

Commonly used for criminal rehabilitation, behavioral control attempts
to limit, block, or expunge a specific behavior from the subject's
psyche.
For example, a murderer may be conditioned against acts of aggression,
or a kleptomaniac might be restricted from stealing.
Some people seek this adjustment willingly, such as socialite glitterati
who restrict their desire to eat, or an addict who cuts out their
craving for a fix.
Behavioral control can also be applied as an unleashing or
reinforcement.
A companion may desire to eliminate their sexual inhibitions, for
example, or a hypercorp exec may boost his commitment to place work
above all else.
A character will simply feel compelled to avoid a behavior that is
limited (perhaps suffering a \[en]10 modifier), but will find it quite
difficult to pursue a behavior that is blocked (requiring a WIL x 3
Test, and suffering a \[en]20 modifier).
They will find themselves completely incapable of initiating a behavior
that is expunged, and if forced into the behavior will suffer a \[en]30
modifier and (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) points of mental Stress.
Likewise, a character will feel compelled to pursue a behavior that is
boosted, and will find it hard to avoid engaging in a behavior that is
encouraged (requiring a WIL x 3 Test to avoid).
They will have no choice but to engage in enforced behaviors, and will
suffer (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) points of mental Stress if prevented from
doing so.

By monitoring memory recall (forcibly invoked if necessary),
psychosurgeons can identify where memories are stored in the brain and
target them for removal.
Memory storage is complex and diffused, however, and often linked to
other memories, so removing one memory may affect others (gamemaster
discretion).
Adding or replacing memories is a much more complicated operation and

Such stimulation is highly addictive, however, so character's exposed to
it for any length of time (over 1 hour, subjective) are likely to pick
up the Addiction trait (p.

Per request, I have compiled a review of the Futura Project and its
fallout, 5 years after whistleblowers and intense media attention forced
us to end the project and release the remaining subjects (dubbed
\[lq]the Lost\[rq] by popular media).
.PP
Futura was a joint initiative spearheaded by Hanto Genomics and strongly
backed by Cognite, with numerous other partners (complete list).
The project was initially proposed by my mentor, Dr.
Antonio Pascal, whose team had proven the feasibility of Accelerated
Life Experience Training (ALET) after a series of pilot studies with two
small (N ≺ 1000) samples.
While it is true that these early pilot studies used both older subjects
and a lesser amount of time dilation, the rationale for the Futura
Project's ambitious program was justified by a remarked decrease in
transhumanity's population due to the Fall, a system\-wide stagnant
population growth rate (blamed on various factors including increased
longevity, available contraception, and rising despair over troubling
times), as well as a desire to move aggressively into a new
technological sector in the hopes of obtaining a competitive advantage.
.PP
Futura began immediately in the wake of the Fall with an initial seed
population of *** test subjects culled from extant genetic material and
gestated to between 1 week and 6 months after birth.
Of these, less than 10% were live births from either a surrogate or
genetic birth mother who had perished during the Fall.
The majority came from our Lunar and Martian labs and were brought to
term within an exowomb.
.PP
After the sample was selected, all subjects were sleeved into our
fast\-growth futura\-brand biomorph bodies and inducted into customized
simulspace accelerated learning environments.
The project made extensive use of emergent technologies and techniques
culled from recaptured TITAN facilities, including neogenetic traits for
the futura morphs and time distortion applications for captive
simulspace populations.
Futura ran concurrently on three different research stations with a
combined staff of 2,211 researchers and support personnel and 45 AGIs
custom\-programmed for expert child development.
Project goals were to raise each child to a subjective 18 years life
experience in 3 years objective time.
.PP
Despite omnipresent observation and real\-time adjusting of the
simulspace and educational programming for optimal normality, somewhere
along the way the project suffered a breakdown in quality assurance and
parameter monitoring that resulted in a near total failure at empathy
modeling.
We first observed this effect 11 months into the project when the
subjects had aged to approximately 6 years of age.
Incidences of animal cruelty and acting out had spiked, though at that
time they remained within acceptable standards.
Over the next few months this trend continued and Dr.
Pascal authorized the usage of more authoritative \[lq]parenting\[rq] to
attempt to correct for the borderline sociopathic behavior that was
being exhibited by 23.19% of all subjects by the 18\- month mark (9
years of age).
.PP
We now know that these changes had the unintended consequence of
suppressing overt displays of cruelty and violence and merely taught the
majority of subjects how to conceal their psychoses.
It was also at this time that the first deaths occurred.
The initial waves were thought to be accidents and both the victim and
perpetrator were usually backed up to a week or so of subjective time.
Post\-project analysis now shows that 43.87% of our subjects had engaged
in at least one act of premeditated murder by the 24\-month mark (12
years of age) and the counseling protocols were only training them how
to lie more effectively.
.PP
It was at this point that myself and Dr.
Aaron Bharani advocated pulling the plug on the project and bringing the
subjects out to real time and intensive counseling.
Dr.
Pascal vetoed our concerns without ever taking them to the board.
As the project spiraled towards its conclusion, a fork of Dr.
Bharani went public at the 34 month mark, inciting a firestorm of
controversy.
While Dr.
Pascal successfully tied up investigators, hoping to see the project
through to its conclusion, the incident at our Legacy research station
occurred.
Initial findings concluded that one or more of the subjects had escaped
the program and were in fact responsible for the habitat's environmental
failures and the thousands of subsequent deaths.
.PP
In the face of intense public and private scrutiny, many of the partners
involved in the project attempted to pull out and even eliminate all
traces of their involvement.
In the resulting chaos, an estimated *** subjects were quietly released
into the system's general population.
It was only after this occurred that all known subjects were identified
as having been infected with the Watts\-Macleod strain of the Exsurgent
virus, though when and how this occurred remains troubling and unclear.
Though later orders resulted in all remaining subjects being euthanized
and/or backed up into cold storage, only of *** the released subjects
were recaptured.
Of the rest, *** pursued sanctuary with sympathetic authorities, ***
went public and submitted themselves to extensive psychotherapy, ***
were killed in incidents of violence and not resurrected, and the rest
presumably went into hiding.
